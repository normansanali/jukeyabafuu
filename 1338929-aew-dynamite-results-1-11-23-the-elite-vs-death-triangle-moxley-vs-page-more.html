He says he has a new appreciation for pro wrestling and his life in general. Cole says all he ever wanted to do was be a pro wrestler, and he has gotten to do that in the best wrestling company on the planet. Cole makes it clear that he was really banged up, and he had two back-to-back “very serious head injuries”. He says he was seeing doctors multiple times a week, and he was going through a rough time. Cole describes how he had anxiety, and he couldn’t sleep, and he’d look at Britt Baker and tell her he didn’t know what was happening. He says the fans have been there for him, and he is eternally grateful for that. Cole then shifts to the bad news.</p><p>He says the bad news is for the AEW locker room because Adam Cole is back. Cole says he’s not going anywhere, and he thought his career was over, but he’s back, and he’s not done yet. He says he won’t stop until he’s the best, and this is the birth of the new Adam Cole. Cole vows to climb to the top of the mountain.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watch out, <a href=#>#AEW</a> locker room – <a href=#>@adamcolepro</a> is BACK, <a href=#>#BayBay</a>!<br>It's <a href=#>#AEWDynamite</a> LIVE on TBS! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rhXEJxOZuF</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 12, 2023</a></p><p>Backstage, The Acclaimed preview their plans for AEW Rampage; they say they’re getting Hollywood stars on the Walk of Fame.</p><p>Perry starts the bout with Moriarty and quickly gains the upper hand.

Takeshita responds, and MJF tells him to speak “American”.&nbsp; Takeshita shoves MJF, and the champion tells the referee to hold Takeshita back. MJF brings up his Iron Match Match against Bryan Danielson and says he can last an hour, and fans can ask their mom or their sister about that. He calls himself the real Iron Man of Professional Wrestling. MJF says he’s about “pinning shoulders on mats and banging rats”. MJF then turns his attention to Ken Jeong, who’s in the crowd, and roasts him before he brings up Freddie Prinze Jr. (also in the crowd) and says, “You ain’t nothing more than a Scooby-Doob-ie Douchebag.” Bryan Danielson runs to the ring and chases MJF away.</p><p>Danielson and Takeshita feel each other out as the match begins.
