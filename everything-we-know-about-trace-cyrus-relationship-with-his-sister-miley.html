Then, he started a solo musical journey, as well as a clothing line, 'Backseats to Bedrooms'.</p><p>Trace and Miley Cyrus are almost the same age. Trace is only 7 months older. These two represent the perfect brother-sister relationship in terms of displaying love and solidarity, particularly in times of crisis. This look at Trace Cyrus' life shows how Trace and Miley support each other through struggles and successes...and broken relationships.</p><p>They always have each other's backs and also influence each other's careers.</p><h2 id=the-complex-ties><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>The Complex Ties</span></h2><p>Trace is Billy Cyrus' stepchild.
