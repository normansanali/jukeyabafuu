He was promoted to the active roster on September 4, 2019.</p><p>Lazard recorded his first professional touchdown, a 35-yard reception from&nbsp;Aaron Rodgers, during a Week 6 win over the&nbsp;Detroit Lions&nbsp;on October 14, 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=allen-lazard-concussion-and-injury></span><span>Allen Lazard Concussion and Injury</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lazard suffered the injury during August 2019 Thursdayâ€™s preseason game against the Raiders, and it was originally diagnosed as a shoulder injury. The second-year receiver will have to clear protocol before heâ€™s allowed to rejoin the team for practice and games. he later returned to the Green Bay Packers as a member of the teamâ€™s 10-player practice squad, according to agent Michael Perrett.</p><p>The Packers cut Lazard while getting the roster down to 53 players on Saturday. His return gives the Packers a quality receiver and special teams player to stash on the practice squad in case of injury. Heâ€™d likely be the teamâ€™s first option if one of the teamâ€™s six receivers went down with an injury during the regular season.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=allen-lazard-40-yard-dash-time></span><span>Allen Lazard 40 Yard Dash Time</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=speed></span>Speed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class="speakable-p-2 p-text">The star wide receiver turned in a strong second time during the 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine.

He had seven touchdowns with 69 catches for 1,018 yards as a junior. Lazard earned an invitation to the Senior Bowl and looked like he had the mid-round potential for the 2018 NFL Draft. However, Lazard went undrafted.</p><p>Sources suggested a few reasons as to why Lazard was not selected. In speaking to one team, they had speed concerns with Lazard. They felt that the 6-foot-4, 227-pounder wasnâ€™t fast enough to transition to the NFL. Another team felt that dropped passes and not being a tough player is what caused them to have Lazard as an undrafted player.</p><p>Lazard had one very ugly practice at the Senior Bowl with a lot of dropped passes to reinforce that concern. As a big possessional receiver, being sure-handed is a basic trait to have. Lazard signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars after he went undrafted.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=allen-lazard-training-camp></span><span>Allen Lazard Training Camp</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>&nbsp;Allen Lazard and <strong>Darrius Shepherd </strong>have accomplished during the first three weeks of training camp to create a buzz about their roster changes, perhaps the most impressive thing the two Green Bay Packers young wide receivers have shown is self-awareness.</p><p>Because while both are in the process of building compelling cases to be on the 53-man roster at campâ€™s end, they also realize this: They havenâ€™t really accomplished anything yet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=allen-lazard-free-agent></span><span>Allen Lazard Free Agent</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Green Bay Packers signed WR <strong>Lazard</strong> to the active roster from the practice squad.
