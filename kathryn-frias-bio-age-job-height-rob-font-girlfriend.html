More recently, as he faced Marlon Vera at UFC (on 30 April 2022) on ESPN 35, fans once again wondered about his girlfriend Kathryn Frias who repeatedly has been seen at his bouts and all over his social media account.</p><p>So, it’s better we already tell you who Kathryn is, her age, job, height, and more.</p><h3><strong>Meet K</strong><strong>athryn Frias, Rob Font Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Kathryn Frias has been Rob Font’s girlfriend since at least late in 2012. And every year during those time, the 18th of October has marked their anniversary. And in those times both have been singing each other praises, especially on Instagram. Kathryn would call him her best friend, her stud muffin, and things like that. Rob also has been grateful for her support in an MMA Fighting interview. He gushed he is fortunate to have a girlfriend who can secure the day-to-day bills and the day-to-day finances so that he could get through an 18-month layoff. He described in 2016 that Kathryn has been taking care of him with finances since like 2010.</p><p>Several years later, as Rob continues his UFC career, Kathryn still is his fan every time.</p><p>The ESPN+ series UFC Destined, of last, also gave fans a glimpse into Rob’s life with Kathryn as she celebrated his UFC Vegas 27 win over Cody Garbrandt in May 2021. Her beau played smart and fought really smart, she thought at the time.</p><p>Kathryn and Rob do not already have human kids but they sure are proud dog parents. In February 2021, Kathryn was sad because her dog’s cancer was spreading.</p><p>So you know, the first time Rob appeared on Kathryn’s social media looking like her boyfriend, it was the December of 2012.</p><h3><strong>Kathryn Frias Age</strong></h3><p>Born in May 1986, Kathryn Frias turned 36 years old in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Kathryn Frias Job</strong></h3><p>Kathryn Frias’s job and career were topics yet out of the reach of the public and the media.</p><p>Speaking of her education, Kathryn graduated from Woburn High School of Woburn, Massachusetts in 2004. We are not sure if she further pursued any degree in college because she always believed that college is not the only way to be successful. She always has had this cross opinion about our school system as she thinks it is not designed to make bosses but to make slaves.</p><p>Kathryn often puts her thoughts on social media that it would have been better if they instead of pushing the collegiate agenda all the time, also mentioned an outside option like a trade school.</p><h3><strong>Is Kathryn Frias On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Indeed! Kathryn Frias could be found on Instagram <a href=#>@misskluvv</a>&nbsp;where she had 75 posts and 1,858 followers as of 2 May 2022.</p><p>Kathryn also occasionally shared glimpses of her life on ‘Kathryn Frias’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>.</p><h3><strong>Kathryn Frias Height</strong></h3><p>Beautiful curly-haired Kathryn Frias stands around 5′ 6” tall in height. This is a few inches shorter than her MMA fighter boyfriend’s 5 ft 8 in (1.73 meters) who in recent times weighed 135 lb.</p><h3><strong>Kathryn Frias Family</strong></h3><p>Kathryn Frias has a brother named Edwin Frias who as a coach helps men unlock their full potential through boxing, mindfulness, strength, and yoga. Also as per LinkedIn, he started teaching full-time Spanish at Catholic Memorial School in September 2020. At the same time, Edwin continued working as a part-time group exercise instructor at Equinox; performance coach at The Club by George Foreman III; designer/owner at FriLove Creations Clothing Company.</p><p>Then, there is Giles Frias, Kathryn’s sister. Not as much is understood about her.</p><p>So, it is apparent that Kathryn and her siblings have been raised by a phenomenal mother. Often they write about the lady on their respective social media. For instance, this one time, Kathryn’s brother called a friend, mentor, protector, and lioness. He gushed that he hopes to be a dad someday like she is a mom to him.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Kathryn Frias’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>The 4th of May is Kathryn Frias’s birthday.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Kathryn Frias From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kathryn was born and bred somewhere in her hometown of Woburn, Massachusetts. Though in recent times, she called Boston Massachusetts her home.</p><p>As for Rob, he is a native of Central Massachusetts. He was born on the 25 of June in 1987 in Tampa, Florida.</p><p>For more about him, let us tell you that he began training as an amateur in 2009 and compiled a record of 3-1 before making his professional debut in December 2011. Later, he compiled a record of 10-1 as a professional, competing for several regional promotions across his native New England before signing with the UFC in the spring of 2014.</p><p>The UFC star then made his promotional debut against George Roop in July 2015 at UFC 175. He (of course) won the fight and earned a Performance of the Night bonus. The rest is history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpJmknb%2B6uoyfqaKZo2KvqruMmp6eZZqkr260xKKeoaxdp7yjecWopa1ll56%2FrbLRopynnF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alex-orji-godfidence.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Orji: The Next Great Michigan Quarterback">&larr;
