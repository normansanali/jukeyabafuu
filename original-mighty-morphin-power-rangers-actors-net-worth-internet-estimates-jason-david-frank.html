The show follows the adventures of a group of "teenagers with attitude" who are chosen to fight the evil alien sorceress <strong>Rita Repulsa</strong>, who has accidentally been released from her confinement and is threatening the Earth. The kids are given the ability to transform into a fighting force, the Power Rangers, and with that, they became the heroes of a generation of kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All The Actors Who’ve Played Barney, Ranked by Net Worth</a></span></p><p>But what's been of the actors that made the show possible?

He loved being a part of the show, and fans can see that if they go to his Instagram page, where he added "Jason, the Red Ranger" as part of his bio. Apart from being a great actor, he's also a martial artist and a paramedic, so needless to say, he's a man of many talents. Some of his other projects include the movies Expose and A Walk with Grace, and he also dabbled into writing in the '90s, when he published his book Karate Warrior: A Beginner's Guide to Martial Arts.

"It’s really cool how positively it affected so many kids. I hear stories from people whose parents were going through a divorce and it was their reprieve from that pain. I met this guy named Matt at the last convention I was at. He said when he was a kid, Power Rangers was his best friend because he was so bullied. Then he looks at me and he goes, 'Thank you for being there before I knew how to laugh.' It was just the sweetest thing anybody has ever said to me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to star in Disney Channel's show Susie Q, she appeared in an episode of <a href=#>Saved by the Bell: The New Class</a>, and worked in the movies Perfect Body and Without Limits.
