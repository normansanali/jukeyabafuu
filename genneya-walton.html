Multiple forms and lessons later, she started a career in dancing, which ultimately led her to acting schools and later a career in acting. Genneya was 12 when she started taking acting classes and soon followed roles in Nickelodeon, and now she is starring in Netflix series Black AF aka #blackAF.</p><p>The actress/dancer was born on 22 February 1999, one of two daughters of her parents in Chicago, Illinois. From a young age, the fun-loving and outgoing nature of Genneya was evident for all to see. Interest in Geology at an early age was followed by dancing craze, which was honed by her parents and, with the help of a trainer, channeled to later success in her life.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BuNTC4RF5Qn/</p><p>Genneya Walton was only 12 years old when she was hired to be the principal dancers for the Just Dance: Disney Part video game.

Pulling back the curtain, the series uncovers and explores the messy, unapologetic and often hilarious world of what it means to be a “new money” Black family trying to get it right in a modern world where “right” is no longer a fixed concept,” according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2020/03/Genneya-Walton-plays-Chloe-Barris-in-the-Netflix-series-Black-AF-aka-blackAF..jpg alt="Genneya Walton plays Chloe Barris in the Netflix series Black AF aka #blackAF." width=450 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Genneya Walton plays Chloe Barris in the Netflix series Black AF aka #blackAF.</strong><br><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Genneya Walton Instagram</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Genneya Walton plays <strong>Chloe Barris</strong> in the series, the eldest of the Barris kids.
