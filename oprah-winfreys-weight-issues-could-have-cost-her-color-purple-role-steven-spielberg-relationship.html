That said, the media mogul’s journey to the top has not been without its headwinds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the 1980s, while trying to land her big-screen breakthrough as Sofia in The Color Purple, <a href=#>the media mogul battled such crippling self-doubt</a>, she actually joined a fat farm to lose weight for the film. Here’s why, were it not for Steven Spielberg’s timely intervention, Winfrey's weight issues might’ve ended up costing her the once-in-a-lifetime role.</p><h2 id=landing-an-audition-for-the-color-purple-was-a-dream-come-true-for-oprah-winfrey>Landing An Audition For The Color Purple Was A Dream Come True For Oprah Winfrey</h2><p>Whether it’s having a multi-billion-dollar net worth, consistently ranking among the most influential people in the world, or earning the nickname “Queen of all media,” Oprah Winfrey doesn’t exactly have a shortage of accomplishments to be proud of.</p><p>However, as surprising as it might be, none of these remarkable achievements inspire the media mogul with as much pride as getting cast in Steven Spielberg’s The Color Purple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/oprah-winfrey-as-sofia-in-the-color-purple-1.jpg><p>Already a huge fan of the book, Winfrey was over the moon when she learned that a film adaptation was in the works. “When I heard that they were doing a movie, I had made a decision that I was going to find a way to get on the`set of that movie,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told NBC News in 2006</a>. “And I started praying for it. Literally like praying for it.”</p><p>As fate would have it, producer Quincy Jones had happened to catch a glimpse of Winfrey's morning show while on a trip to Chicago, and was dead set on casting her as Sofia in the film. “When I first saw Oprah in Chicago, on Chicago AM, I didn't know who she was,” Jones recalled during an interview with NBC News.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I said ‘That's Sophie. I don't know who it is, but it's Sophie. If she can act, then it's really Sophie.’"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Rosie O'Donnell And Oprah Winfrey?</a></span></p><p>Despite having little to no acting experience, Winfrey nailed her audition for the role, leaving producer Quincy Jones in awe. “She tore it up. It came flowing out - just rolling out of her everything,” Jones admitted to NBC News. “Every mood, kaleidoscopic characterization and everything else just came out. And it was improvised.”</p><h2 id=oprah-winfrey-joined-a-fat-farm-after-waiting-on-the-color-purple-rsquo-s-casting-team-for-months>Oprah Winfrey Joined A Fat Farm After Waiting On The Color Purple’s Casting Team For Months</h2><p>Despite being a shoo-in for the role, Oprah Winfrey had to wait for months before she finally heard back from the film’s casting team. Frustrated by the long wait, the media mogul decided to take matters into her own hands, placing a rather ill-advised call to Reuben Cannon; the film’s casting agent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Reuben says to me, ‘You don’t call me. I call you. And I didn’t call you,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she recalled during her 2016 appearance at Essence Fest</a>. “Do you understand I have real actresses who have auditioned for this part.’ I hung up the phone and start crying,”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oprah-winfrey-smiling.jpg><p>Following the heart-wrenching phone call, the media mogul became convinced that her weight issues had cost her the role. “I decide that this is because the fat has finally caught up with me. Now I must get rid of the fat,” she said.</p><p>“In two weeks I’m going to go to a fat farm, and I’m going to lose 25 pounds. I’m going to drink a lot of green juice. I’m going to have cleanses and colonics.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hugh Grant Got Brutally Honest During His Interview With Oprah Telling the Host, 'I Really Want To Shut You Up'</a></span></p><p>Determined to shrink down by 25 pounds, Winfrey went ahead and joined a fat farm. “I go out on the track by myself. It's cold. It's raining,” she recounted during her interview with NBC News. “I'm alone running around the track. And I start asking “God, dear God, just like Celie. Please help me to let it go so that I can move on with my life.” And I start singing, “I surrender all. I surrender all.”</p><h2 id=how-steven-spielberg-saved-oprah-winfrey-rsquo-s-role-in-the-color-purple>How Steven Spielberg Saved Oprah Winfrey’s Role In The Color Purple</h2><p>Just as she was about to completely give up on the role, Winfrey received a life-altering phone call from none other than legendary director Steven Spielberg. “The instant I let it go, a woman comes running out of the cafeteria screaming, ‘Ofrey, is your name Ofrey?,’” she recalled during her 2016 appearance at Essence Fest. “Ten years, still no one knew how to pronounce my name. ‘Somebody is on the telephone for you, says his name is Spielberg.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/steven-spielberg-smiling.jpg><p>Having gotten word that Winfrey had joined a fat farm, Spielberg was quick to point out how completely unnecessary, and potentially detrimental losing weight for the role would be. “He says, “First of all, what are you doing? I hear you're at a fat farm.' No, [I say] 'it's a health retreat. It's a health retreat,” she recalled during her interview with NBC News. “He says, 'If you lose a pound, you will possibly lose this part. I'd like to see you in my office tomorrow.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Oprah Winfrey Still Own Part Of Weight Watchers After Losing Around $117 Million Of Her Net Worth When The Share Price Tanked?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Glad that her weight issues wouldn’t be an impediment to securing her dream role, Oprah speedily made her way out of the fat farm, making a brief pit stop at a Dairy Queen just in case her stay had been fruitful.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Battling An Eating Disorder At The Time, Oprah Asked The Olsen Twins A Question She Likely Regrets</a></span></p><p>“I pack my bags and I leave this health retreat.
