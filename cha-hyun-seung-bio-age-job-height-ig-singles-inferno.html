However, his addiction to the show wasn’t unforeseen. Back when its trailer hit the screen, many noticed a person with similar tattoos to him. Turns out it was Cha Hyun-Seung.</span></p><p><span>Contestants who entered the show before him were <a href=#>Song Ji A</a>, Choi Si Hun, Kang So Yeon, Kim Jun Sik, An Yea Won, <a href=#>Oh Jin Taek</a>, Shin Ji Yeon, Moon Se Hoon, and Kim Hyeon-Joong.</span></p><p><span>Also, it seems that Cha already knew contestants Kim and Song, way before joining </span><i><span>Single’s Inferno</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>For those of you new to the show, </span><i><span>Single’s Inferno</span></i><span> is unlike other dating shows, filled with fun and parties. The contestants on the Korean show are left on a deserted island with the bare necessities and an opportunity to find love. And the only way to escape this “hellish” place was to pair up and head for date nights in “Paradise”.</span></p><p><span>Talking about his dating history, Cha broke up with his last girlfriend back in 2018. He’s been single ever since. Guess, he’s finally ready to move on and reinvigorate his love life now.</span></p><p><span>The last we saw him, Cha was coupled up with Song Ji A on day 5 and day 6.</span></p><p><span>Previously, Song and Kim Hyeon-Joong went for the date night in “Paradise” on day 1 and day 2, after mutually choosing one another.

He has worked for bands like StrayKids, EXO, Taeyeon, Girls’ Generation, Yezi, and multiple other K-pop groups. But mostly, he spent time working as a main dancer for solo artist Sunmi.</span></p><p><span>Some even say that Cha stole the spotlight from Sunmi at the 2018 Waterbomb festival. Well, he did have the audience enhanced with his muscular figure at the performance but we’re not sure about him completing stealing the spotlight.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The pair had been working together ever since Sunmi’s solo debut with the song 24 Hours in 2014.
