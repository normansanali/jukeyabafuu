Read all that we know about his age, height, family, and more.</p><p>This piece covers it all so keep scrolling dow this article to learn more about him.</p><h3><strong>Temptation Island: Are Paris Pedro And Great Ezihie Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Given the prominence of TikTok in the story of Great Ezihie and Paris Pedro’s union, it is clear that it is a narrative for the present. As it turned out, he had uploaded his video on the aforementioned portal for short videos, and she didn’t waste any time taking her shot by posting a positive comment for him on it.</p><p>As they met in person, the chemistry between them became more apparent, and Paris developed a renewed admiration for Great’s brown eyes and musculature.</p><p>Due to their divergent perspectives on the progression of their relationship, <a href=#>Paris</a> and Great, who had been dating for almost two years, chose to participate in the USA Network program. She wanted to start a family with her partner, but he was hesitant since he felt they were still too young to let go of their past partying ways.</p><p>But because early marriage is relatively frequent in Angolan society, Paris is even more adamant about beginning a new chapter in her life.</p><p>Paris chose to participate in the social experiment, but there are also personal worries that drove her decision. She claimed that because of her past, she fears being betrayed, and the reality program will be a test of Great’s loyalty. Paris even declared on national television that she would never forgive her boyfriend if he had an extramarital affair. Great worried that Paris would find someone to connect with and that he did not want to lose her to someone else in the meanwhile.</p><p>Uncertainty surrounds Paris and Great’s connection as of this writing. We have cause to assume that the two broke up when the cameras stopped filming, though, based on a number of films that were uploaded to the former’s TikTok account.</p><p>Paris allowed her 300,000+ followers a peek into her personal life in the weeks before the eagerly awaited premiere of Season 5, and our findings indicate that there is plenty of tea to be sipped. Fans of Temptation Island can’t help but note that after she returned from paradise, she blogged a lot about an anonymous ex-boyfriend.</p><p>“Me celebrating because [no matter] how hard life gets, I’m not staying with a man who cheated on me,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captioned</a> the clip. Additionally, the reality TV personality intimated that she might or might not be dating other men in a few videos.</p><p>Given this, we are left wondering what actually transpired between the two. One thing is certain, though: Season 5 of Temptation Island exposes both their warning signs and dark secrets. In a Season 5 teaser, Paris remarked, “I feel like him being in the house, it’s going to show me his true colors.”</p><h3><strong>Great Ezihie Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1996, Gret Ezihie reached the age of 26 in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Great Ezihie Family</strong></h3><p>Gret Ezihie is the son of Samuel and Vivian Ezihie.
