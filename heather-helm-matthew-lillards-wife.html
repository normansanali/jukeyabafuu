Heather works for Compass, a real estate technology company, and has a lengthy career in the real estate industry. Despite her enormous success in real estate, Heather is best known in the general public as the actor Matthew Lillard’s wife.</strong></p><p>Helm not only has a prosperous career but also a respectable family. She was a wonderful mother of three and had a wonderful connection with her actor husband.</p><h2><span id=Heather_Helm_Who_Is_She>Heather Helm: Who Is She?</span></h2><p>Heather Helm is currently a realtor with Compass, as we just reported. In addition, she is a partner in Pacific Union International, another real estate firm.</p><p>On July 17, 1971, in Pasadena, California, Heather Helm was born in the United States. La Canada High School was her high school, that she attended from 1987 to 1989. She enrolled in the University of California, Los Angeles shortly after in 1989, and in 1993, she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English literature.</p><h2><span id=Career_Heather_Helm_Is_A_Successful_Real_Estate_Agent>Career: Heather Helm Is A Successful Real Estate Agent</span></h2><p>At fifty, Heather enjoys a prosperous profession in the real estate industry. She has been employed at Compass (previously Ted Clark and Partners) as a director in the estates sector since January 2018. Helm first knew Ted as his customer, but she and Ted quickly grew close enough for her to join Compass as Ted’s partner.</p><p>She also has a stake in Pacific Union International, another real estate firm. Even though she has a respectable reputation in the real estate industry now, her career did not start out that way.</p><p>In reality, she started working for The Walt Disney Company as Director of Special Event Marketing as soon as she graduated. Heather was able to refine her marketing abilities throughout her time at The Walt Disney, which turned out to be quite beneficial. After relocating to Pasadena and starting a family, she changed her job to real estate.</p><h2><span id=She8217s_Interested_in_Social_Work>She’s Interested in Social Work</span></h2><p>Heather, Matthew Lillard’s wife, is equally interested in social welfare.

Actor Matthew Lillard from Scream is her husband. On August 12, 2000, the couple exchanged vows and have been together ever since.</p><p>According to rumors, Heather and Matthew, who are now husband and wife, dated for some time before deciding to be married. Even though it has been more than 20 years since their wedding, they still have a wonderful marriage.</p><p>Matthew just published a lovely post from his early years with his wife on August 27, 2020. He included some lovely remarks in the caption that captured his years-long adventure with his Helm. He penned</p><p>When we first met, when we said “yes,” and right now. When you’re married to your closest friend, the twenty years fly by. Hey Heather Lillard, I adore you.</p><p>Speaking about their initial encounter, they said it happened at a party. It is said that as soon as Heather revealed that she was attending her friend’s wedding in Italy, Matthew fell head over heels in love with Helm and extended an invitation to attend.</p><p>Her three children are under her care.</p><p>The lovely Heather is a mother of three children. Addison Grace Lillard, her first child, was born in 2002 as a daughter and weighed 6 pounds, 10 ounces. In 2004, she brought her second daughter Macey into the world. In 2008, her only son Liam, her third child, was born.</p><p>The five-member family gets along well together. The family never fails to make an impression, whether it’s celebrating an occasion or going out to supper. Actually, Heather and her spouse Matthew love posting images of their children on social media.</p><h2><span id=Her_Spouse_Is_A_Promising_Performer>Her Spouse Is A Promising Performer</span></h2><p>As we previously said, Heather’s spouse Matthew is a well-known actor who has starred in a number of films and television shows.

Mad Love, If These Walls Could Talk, Scream, Scream 2, Scream 4, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, Endless Bummer, and many more are among his popular movies.</p><h2><span id=Heather_Helm_Uses_Social_Media_Frequently>Heather Helm Uses Social Media Frequently</span></h2><p>An accomplished realtor Heather uses social media quite frequently.
