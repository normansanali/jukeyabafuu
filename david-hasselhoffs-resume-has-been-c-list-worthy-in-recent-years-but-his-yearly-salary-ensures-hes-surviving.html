That's especially true given his Baywatch pay. The actor earned $100 million during its 11 year run. In addition, he was able to ink a massive residual deal worth $4 million per year, a salary he still gets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, David's divorce set him back. The settlement agreed on was $120 million, along with payments of $66K per month. Because of that, the actor has stayed active, even in less than stellar roles.</p><p>At the very least, the actor has the Baywatch residuals to fall back on. The actor himself admits the chances of Baywatch's popularity were very slim, especially after its cancelation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/david-hasselhoff.jpg><p>“I think the favorite thing about Baywatch was the fact that it was all run by us,” he said.</p><p>“The show was canceled, we brought it back, and there was four of us. So one of us was a writer, one of us was a director, one of us was the lifeguard, and David Hasselhoff was the PR guy, the star, keeping up the morale. … Keeping it afloat, and keeping it positive, and keeping it light.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/michael-richards-hasn-t-acted-in-years-but-his-current-yearly-salary-ensures-he-s-more-than-okay-front-deposit-back-commons-licenses.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Michael Richards Hasn't Acted In Years But His Current Yearly Salary Ensures He's More Than Okay</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Starring in Seinfeld has significantly influenced Michael Richards' life, even though he hasn't appeared on screens for quite some time.</span><p>It definitely enjoyed quite the turnaround and Hasselhoff was able to make millions off of it.

Near the end of the series, it changed to $300,000, still nothing close to Hasselhoff-type money. Anderson's son defended his mom and how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she made no money from Baywatch</a>, despite the show's success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-16.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She was definitely being taken advantage of,” Anderson’s son, Brandon Lee told Variety. “It still feels weird, how there hasn’t been some sort of discussion with Amazon, or the ‘Baywatch’ producers to get her her fair share. It’s funny how it works with Dave Chappelle with Netflix; he can somehow go back and get paid for a show that he didn’t own anything of. And with the Amazon library deal, we didn’t get a penny.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pamela-anderson-s-generous-act-with-her-five-figure-salary-for-a-playboy-shoot-caused-more-harm-than-good-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Pamela Anderson's Generous Act With Her Five Figure Salary For A Playboy Shoot Caused More Harm Than Good</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Pamela Anderson's $25K contribution thanks to Playboy was frowned upon by certain organizations.</span><p>Despite the lower pay for Anderson, she still maintains a net worth higher than David, doubling his total to $20 million.

One of those decisions was turning down the chance to play Superman. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Baywatch star was "really close" to playing the role</a>. The actor was told he'd be type cast as that character for the rest of his career. Looking back, Hasselhoff doesn't feel like that was a bad thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/david-hasselhoff.jpg><p>"A long time ago, I was up for Superman, and my manager at the time said to me, “I don’t think you should do Superman, because if you do Superman, you’ll be Superman for the rest of your life.” And you know, Christopher Reeve went on to be Superman in real life and in films and in all kinds of different films. That was probably the worst advice."</p><p>Hasselhoff tells A.V. Club that he embraces the roles he is remembered for by fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When people say, “You’re such a nice guy. You still embrace Knight Rider and Baywatch! Most actors get really upset!” What? Why?! I mean, look at Schwarzenegger. He went right back to the Terminator. Get over it. You’re lucky if you get one hit. You’re freaking lucky if you get one hit! I’ve had like five or six. So that’s the advice I got, and I’m still laughing about that, because I was really close to getting Superman, and we pulled out of it."</p><p>It would've been interesting to see the actor in such a role.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqprdKsnKWgn5uztHnRnqqupZVitaK%2FjJucnqZdmHqttdKtZLCnoqm1unnIp2SrnZOau7V52J6Yq6tdl8K1eceiqmaxlZa%2FrcWMrJilmaKueqa60q6pnqtdnbK0edKuqa%2Bhpp67qHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-chris-liang-incapacitated-firebaugh-california-missing-case-update-245134-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Chris Liang Incapacitated?
