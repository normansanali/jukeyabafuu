Likewise, he is best known for his appearances on the LTC reality television series 19 Kids and Counting which aired from 2008 to 2015. Prior to that, he served in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2003 as a Republican member. Also, he was a candidate for the 2012 U.S. Senate.</p><p>He was born on July 18, 1965, in Tontitown, Washington County, Arkansas, the USA. His birth name is <strong>James Robert Duggar</strong>. His mother <strong>Mary Duggar</strong> died on June 9, 2019, while his father <strong>Jimmy Lee Duggar</strong> also left the world in 2009. Further, he has one sister, <strong>Deanna Duggar </strong>who is a Gospel singer. So far, he holds an American nationality and is of white ethnicity.</p><h2>Married For Over Three Decades</h2><p>Yes, Jim is the proud husband of <strong>Michelle Duggar</strong> whom he is happily married for about 35 years. Born as <strong>Michelle Annette Duggaris</strong>, she is the 7th born kid of <strong>Ethel Ruark</strong> and <strong>Garrett Ruark</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/7/2/a33a26e8bc52295768167d3a3a502592-1593700739749.jpg><p>Duggar, 54, and his wife, Michelle, 53, were married on July 21, 1984, in a private ceremony. The function was held in Rodgers, Arkansas at Cross Church in front of over 200 guests. For their marriage rituals, the bride wore a stunning white gown originally worn by Jim's late mother, Mary.</p><p>"Everything we did for our wedding was so inexpensive, but perfect for us," they told sources. &nbsp;Likewise, for their honeymoon, the newlyweds went to the lodge at Mount Nebo and Lake Fort Smith, Arkansas.</p><p><strong>Jim Bob and Michelle's Early Years | 19 Kids and Counting</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Mrs. Duggar once said in a 2014 interview that they always wanted to spend their money on their honeymoon. It's because it was their first time together to be alone.</p><h2>Altogether 19 Children and 12 Grandkids</h2><p>Yes, it sounds pretty shocking, but it's the truth. The Duggars currently have 10 boys and 9 girls, and all their names begin with "J." The entire family appeared on TLC's reality show 19 Kids and Counting from 2008 to 2015.</p><p>On March 3, 1988, they welcomed their firstborn son, <strong>Joshua James </strong>to the world. Soon after, the twins <a href=#><strong>Jana Marie</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <strong>John-David</strong> were born on January 12, 1990. More precisely, Jim and Michelle always wanted more children as a blessing from God.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/7/2/150403-duggar-police-report-cheat_hkzxip-1-1593703282390.jpg><p>Then the couple went to have 16 more children.

On 8 November 2011, Annette became pregnant with her 20th child, <strong>Jubilee Shalom</strong>. But that it was revealed on December 8, 2011, that she had been miscarried.</p><p>Today Jim Bob and his long term partner Michelle have a total of 12 grandchildren from their kid's marital relationship. Similarly, the whole family is Independent Baptist Christians.</p><h2>The Impressive Net Worth of Jim Duggar</h2><p>As of early July 2020, Jim Bob<strong> </strong>Duggar has accumulated the whopping net worth of<strong> $3.5 million</strong>.&nbsp;He credits most of her fortune to his successful career of working as a politician, real estate agent, and television personality.</p><p>As per his salary, Jim makes in the range from<strong> $25,000</strong> to<strong> $45,000 </strong>per episode as the primary payee for Counting On. In addition, he is a certified realtor who owns several commercial properties in his local area. Not just real estate, but he was also known as the seat of the US Senate in 2008.</p><p>So, Duggar has secured a substantial amount as deputy leader of the House Corrections and criminal law Sub-Committee. In fact, he and his wife endorsed Mike Huckabee, a former governor in his 2008 Republican presidential election campaign.</p><p>More to that, the couple endorsed the former Republican United States Senator <strong>Rick Santorum</strong>, in January 2012. In 2013 they began to support <strong>Ken Cuccinelli.</strong></p><p><i><strong>Stay Tuned With </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong> To Know More About Politicians!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqOgpmWSpK9usNSgnpqq</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brooke-burke-charvet-bra-size-age-weight-height-measurements.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brooke Burke-Charvet Bra Size, Age, Weight, Height, Measurements">&larr;
