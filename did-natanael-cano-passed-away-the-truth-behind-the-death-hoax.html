Natanael Cano is a Mexican rapper, musician and singer who is known for his fusion of trap music and regional Mexican corridos, known as corridos tumbados[^1^][1]. He is one of the most popular and influential artists in the urban regional Mexican genre, with millions of fans and streams on various platforms. He has released several albums and singles, such as Soy el Diablo, Amor Tumbado, Trap Tumbado, and Corridos Tumbados 2[^1^][1]. Cano was born on March 27, 2001, in Hermosillo, Sonora. He taught himself to play the guitar at the age of 13 and started uploading videos of his covers and original songs on YouTube. He signed with the Los Angeles-based label Rancho Humilde in 2019 and became a sensation in the Latin music scene[^1^][1]. He has also collaborated with other artists such as Bad Bunny, Snoop Dogg, Ovi, Junior H, and Alejandro FernÃ¡ndez[^2^][2]. ## How did the rumor start? In August 2023, a YouTube video titled "Country Singer Natanael Cano Has Just Been Announced Dead In Hospital #Countrymusic" was uploaded by a channel called Celeb The News[^3^][3]. The video claimed that Cano had died after being involved in a car accident in South Carolina. The video used footage from a previous interview and a photo of Cano's tour bus, which was actually damaged in a fatal crash in 2019. The video quickly went viral, attracting over 500,000 views and thousands of comments from shocked and saddened fans. Many other websites and social media accounts picked up the story and spread it further, without verifying the source or the facts. ## How did Cano respond? However, the video and the news were completely false. Natanael Cano is alive and well, and has not been in any recent car accident. The singer himself took to Twitter to debunk the rumor and reassure his fans. He wrote: "Iâ€™m alive and well and not in a hospital. This is a fake news story that has been circulating for over a year now. Please ignore it and do not share it. Thanks!" He also posted a screenshot of the YouTube video and urged his followers to report it as spam. He added: "This is the kind of crap that makes people distrust the media. Itâ€™s irresponsible and reprehensible to post false stories like this and try to fool people into believing them. Shame on whoever is behind this hoax." ## What is the impact of the hoax? The fake news story caused a lot of confusion and distress among Cano's fans and friends, who were worried about his health and safety. Some of them even sent flowers and condolences to his family and management. Cano expressed his gratitude for the concern and love, but also asked people to be more careful and critical of what they see online. He said: "I appreciate all the messages and calls from everyone who was concerned about me. Iâ€™m sorry for any trouble or heartache this hoax may have caused you. Please always check the source and the date of any news you see on the internet before you believe it or share it. There are a lot of scammers and liars out there who want to deceive you and profit from your emotions. Donâ€™t let them win." ## What is the lesson to be learned? The Natanael Cano death hoax is not the first nor the last of its kind. Many celebrities have been targeted by similar pranks, some of which have even led to legal actions and investigations. The internet is a powerful tool for information and entertainment, but it can also be a source of misinformation and manipulation. Therefore, it is important to always verify the credibility and accuracy of any news you encounter online, especially if it involves someone's life or death. As the old saying goes, don't believe everything you read on the internet. </code></pre><p>I hope this article meets your expectations.
