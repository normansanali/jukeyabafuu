Source: Wikimedia Commons</span><p>In the late 1960s, it was probably not a good idea to hang around with Charles Manson. Dennis Wilson didn't know that -- but nobody did, at least, not the way we know today. Dennis Wilson,<span>&nbsp;<a href=#>brother of Brian Wilson</a>, was a co-founder of The Beach Boys; Charles Manson, on the other hand, is perhaps the most famous (certainly the most infamous) cult leader in American history. On his orders, Manson's followers -- the "Manson Family" as they were known -- carried out the <a href=#>Tate-Labianca murders</a> in 1969, leaving seven people dead, including actress Sharon Tate. The group's goal was to realize Manson's apocalyptic vision of a massive race war, a scenario he described as "Helter Skelter."</span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>No One Knew How Dangerous Manson Was</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/230a8d8f36ce5482fa28f4159de7a651.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(shindig magazine)</span><p>We're aware of all this today, but back in the spring of 1968, when Dennis Wilson let the Manson Family into his life and his home, the group's darkest deeds were still a year off. While living with Dennis Wilson, Charles Manson and his swarm of STD-infested scavengers relentlessly took advantage of Wilson’s kindness. They destroyed his home, his cars, and his credit. Wilson, who died in 1983 after a long struggle with addiction, never recovered from his time spent living with the family, and blamed himself for the deaths that occurred after the Manson Family moved from his home in the Palisades to the emptiness of Spahn Ranch.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Two Hitchhikers Introduced Wilson To Manson</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/e1ef65d58df73dbf072993a153d98cea.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p>Dennis Wilson may never have met Charles Manson if he hadn’t been so prone to picking up hitchhikers, especially young female hitchhikers. In the spring of 1968 Wilson saw Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey thumbing it on the side of the road and brought them home for milk and cookies. This act of kindness turned his life upside down.</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The Manson Family Just Took Over Wilson's Home</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/60529550b0410173b0e58c504d2e67fa.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p>The girls returned to Wilson’s rented home in the Pacific Palisades, and when he left to record tracks with the Beach Boys they never left. When he returned he found a party in full swing, and a bearded, dirty stranger waiting for him in his driveway. The man was Charles Manson, and in order to make Wilson feel comfortable he supposedly got on his knees and kissed the drummer’s feet. Wilson spent the rest of ’68 partying with the freeloading Manson family.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Satan In The Midst</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/ba18948ae33a44a35664212fc1b62641.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p>In <a href=#><strong>a wide ranging interview with ABC</strong></a>, Beach Boys front man Mike Love spoke about Dennis Wilson's decision to hang with Manson, referring to it as "an unfortunate episode" in the band's career and that Wilson "unknowingly invited Satan into our midst." He continued:</p>Dennis was enthralled by him at one time, and it didn’t hurt that Charlie Manson came with this group of girls – young girls, who were very enamored with Charlie, and looked up to him as a leader.<h3 class=article_sub_title>The Family Wrecked Wilson’s Cars</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/67c47fe3ead130d91fda168931165cf4.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>A 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 NART Spyder.

Manson, after all, had something for Dennis—a stable of young women who catered to his every desire.” Because he was blinded by the young women who swarmed about Manson, Wilson didn’t care that the Family was slowly eroding his life and his possessions like rats in the wall of a decaying home.</span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Manson And Wilson Fed Off Each Other</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/e3800e56447c13a439ce7846ac5bcbd9.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p>Former Manson girl Dianne Lake later said:</p>I think the two must have hit it off.

Notable figures in the music industry, such as Gregg Jakobson and Terry Melcher, were among the celebrities introduced to Manson through these events hosted at Wilson's star-studded home.</p><p>In the book Helter Skelter, Jakobson remembered:</p>Dennis used to call Charlie ‘The Wizard.'&nbsp;He really thought that Charlie was magical.<h3 class=article_sub_title>A Seedy Little Character</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/0458fa3beda326ae926b8e084297e83c.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p>Johnny Echols of the band Love said of Manson:</p>I just thought he was a seedy little character.&nbsp;The weirdest thing was, first the parties were in the guest house, and Manson and his crew would be there.

But that’s not the worst of it, gearheads. The Wilson brothers loved their Ferrari 275GTBs -- both Brian and Dennis owned one. Manson Family members borrowed Brian's, and crashed it. Later, they also managed to wreck Dennis Wilson’s Ferrari 275GTB while driving around downtown LA.</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>They Blew $100,000 Of Wilson’s Money</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/2417a98478ec4ffc51049f4b4b63a211.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: "Inside the Manson Cult: The Lost Tapes," via amazon.com</span><p>While living with Wilson throughout 1968 the Family took full advantage of their plush and undeserved digs. Everything the family bought during their stay with Wilson was paid for by the Beach Boy. They racked up huge bills on the drummer’s credit cards, and according to Karina Longworth, the host of You Must Remember This<span>, </span><a href=#>the family ran up an $800 tab</a><span> at a local dairy in Wilson’s name.

His clothes, his gold records -- if it wasn’t nailed down, the Family saw it as theirs for the taking. Around this time, Wilson started distancing himself from the cult leader and his family, but instead of asking them to leave, calling the police, or just throwing them out on the lawn by the scruff of the neck, he simply moved into another house. But Manson wouldn’t be ignored. He left a note for Dennis at his new place that read “you can’t get away from me.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The Family Gave Wilson Gonorrhea</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/b417399f2c2fed82ab7b622957f27ea8.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>A story on Dennis Wilson from from The Record Mirror, a British music weekly, dated 1968.</span><p>As if wrecking his cars and running up huge bills weren’t bad enough, all of the group fun that the gang was engaging in took a turn for the worse (as it tends to do).
