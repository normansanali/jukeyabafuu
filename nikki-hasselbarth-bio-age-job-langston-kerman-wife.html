Viewers especially seem to love how in every episode they got to see their favorite star’s guest star as a ghost. For instance, the up-and-coming actor Langston Kerman with TV series credits such as Insecure and Bless This Mess, featured as a ghost in Episode 5. So, in the rest of the writing, we shall tell you about his wife Nikki Hasselbarth, her age, job, life as an actor’s wife, and more.</p><h3><strong>Meet Nikki Hasselbarth, Langston Kerman Wife</strong></h3><p>Langston, who played a deceased doctor “Dr. BooBoo” in&nbsp;Not Dead Yet, married beautiful Nikki Hasselbarth on 6 October 2019. “Yesterday I married the love of my life and it’s the happiest I’ve ever felt. I’m still going to introduce her as my sidepiece though”, Langstone announced of their wedding on his Instagram <a href=#>@langstonkerman</a>.</p><p>Fast forward to today and they are still doing great. For instance, on 2023’s Valentine’s Day, we saw Langston write “Happy Valentine’s Day to the two girls who cuss me out the most. Someone please help” next to a couple of lovely pictures of his wife and their daughter.</p><p>In a podcast from August 2018, Langston and Nikki together gave away a lot of their early relationship details while they also chatted about career balance, courtship, and more.</p><p>Based on what they said at the time, the couple met sometime before October 2015 at a mutual friend’s house in Chicago. Laughing, Langston said he bought her a liter of petrol and it all started from there. Next, they gave away the ‘how they “hook up”‘ story. After the first meeting, they had fun for a week or so and got quite close. But, soon Nikki started to think the long distance to be a dealbreaker considering where he lived and where she lived. Langston somehow persuaded her to just keep talking and get to each other. But, within 2 months he said it was just him talking. Nikki in her defense said that she was busy working long hours and taking care of her mother.</p><p>Eventually, Langston anyway convinced Nikki to come to one of his college gigs and that is when they started dating. When Langston was asked what it is about Nikki that made him so persistent, he said he found her to be very pretty and smart and yet very kind.</p><h3><strong>Do Nikki Hasselbarth And Langston Kerman Have Kids Yet?</strong></h3><p>On 8 May 2022, Langston Kerman wished his wife Mother’s Day calling her “the lady who matters most” to him and his baby. “Our baby goes out in public chewing a giant piece of an alphabet floor mat, but I don’t blame you for that. We love you all the same”, he also teased afterward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nikki-hasselbarth-bio-age-job-langston-kerman-wife-2023-1-300x256.jpg><p>So, yes. The couple has a kid and she is their daughter who finally showed up in October 2021. Her name is Kensington.</p><p>When the young one turned one year on 7 October 2022, Langston took to his social media several beautifully captured moments of his baby and next to it wrote “One year in and truly can’t believe we get to hang out with someone so cool. Cheers to another year of picking up sticks and petting dogs way too hard”.</p><h3><strong>Nikki Hasselbarth Age</strong></h3><p>Nikki Hasselbarth was born in 1983.

Kerman, of Clevland passed away in February 2021. he was enlisted in the U.S. Army at age 17 and served with the 115th Regiment during WWII. After the war, he pursued medical studies at the University of Cincinnati and eventually started a private practice in Montgomery, Ohio.</p><h3><strong>Nikki Hasselbarth Job</strong></h3><p>Nikki Hasselbarth on her social media Bio goes around as a lawyer and nonprofit advisor.
