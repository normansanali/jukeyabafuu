Ruffalo ultimaltey waited until their daughter was a week old to share the scary news with his wife, Sunrise Coigney.</p><p>“When I told Sunny about it, first she thought I was joking,” he said, explaining how his wife was in disbelief. “And then she just burst into tears and said, ‘I always knew you were gonna die young.”</p><p>Ruffalo also revealed what pushed him to get tested for a brain tumor, and it wasn’t symptoms like some people may expect. Rather, the actor admits he had a dream that told him about the tumor, pushing him to get it looked after.</p><p>“I had one of those 4 a.m. calls and I woke up probably around 3 a.m. and I just had this crazy dream,” Mark explained. “And it wasn’t like any other dream I’d ever had. It was just like, ‘You have a brain tumor.’ It wasn’t even a voice. It was just pure knowledge, ‘You have a brain tumor, and you have to deal with it immediately.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ruffalo-rsquo-s-tumor-left-him-permanently-deaf-in-one-ear>Ruffalo’s Tumor Left Him Permanently Deaf In One Ear<img alt="Mark Ruffalo and wife Sunrise " data-image-id=251007 data-mobile-optimized=true height=614 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screen-shot-2024-01-25-at-2-13-16-pm.png width=808 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>The actor said that the only symptom he had was an ear infection, though he hadn’t connected the dots it could be a tumor. Still, after the prophetic dream, Ruffalo went to the doctor and insisted they test him to figure out if something was indeed wrong.</p><p>“I said ‘Listen, this is going to sound crazy, but I had this dream last night that I had a brain tumor,’” he explained, saying his doctor even had a CAT scan done despite there being no evidence a the time to suggest it was a tumor. “And I was like, ‘Great, I am crazy. Just do it anyway.’”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screen-shot-2024-01-25-at-2-13-16-pm.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Mark Ruffalo Almost Passed On His Iconic '13 Going On 30' Role">Mark Ruffalo Almost Passed On His Iconic '13 Going On 30' Role</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>'13 Going on 30' is one of the most iconic 2000s rom-com, so what made Mark Ruffalo nearly turn down the role?</p><p>He recalls the doctor being surprised when something did eventually turn up on the scan, saying, “She comes in and she’s just kind of, like, a zombie. And she says, ‘You have a mass behind your left ear the size of a golf ball. We don’t know what it is, we can’t tell until it’s biopsied.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, the tumor ended up being benign, but Ruffalo said the subsequent ear infections did leave him “completely deaf” in one ear. “Take my hearing but let me keep the face and just let me be the father of these kids,” he said.</p><p>Mark met his wife, Sunrise, in the late 1990s, and they eventually married on June 11, 2000. The couple welcomed their first child, a son named Keen, on June 27, 2001.
