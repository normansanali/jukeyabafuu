Jacinda was born on July 26, 1980, in Hamilton, New Zealand. She grew up in Morrinsville and Murupara. After announcing her resignation on February 7, the 42-year-old has been the current Prime Minister of New Zealand since January 18, 2023.</p><p>Ardern is New Zealand’s youngest Prime Minister, having been elected on October 26, 2017, at the age of 37. She is also the first New Zealand leader to get pregnant while in office, and the world’s second (after Benazir Bhutto) to do so.&nbsp;Netizens are wondering about Jacinda’s family and personal life after she abruptly announced her departure. So, here’s an article on the current Prime Minister’s family history and personal life.</p><h2>Jacinda Ardern’s Parents: Ross and Laurell Ardern</h2><p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s parents are Ross and Laurell Ardern. Jacinda’s father, Ross, was a police officer stationed in the Bay of Plenty hamlet of Murupara, where she spent her youth. Ross has a twin brother, Ian Ardern, who is a general authority in the Latter-day Saints Church. On February 28, 1954, they were born.&nbsp;Ross Ardern, a former police officer, is also a diplomat; he served as the administrator of Tokelau from 2018 to 2022. He served as Niue’s police commissioner from 2005 to 2009 and as New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Niue from 2014 to 2018.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jacinda-Ardern-2.jpg alt="Jacinda Ardern" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ross joined the New Zealand Police in 1974 and was one of the policemen involved in the 1970s Dawn Raids on Pacific Island families.&nbsp;He was a police officer for 40 years, 20 of which he worked in the Criminal Investigation Branch. Laurell Ardern, Jacinda’s mother, also worked as a culinary assistant at a school.</p><h2>Jacinda Ardern Siblings</h2><p><strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong> is the youngest of her parents’ two children; she has an elder sister, Louise.&nbsp;Ray Dussan, a Colombian national, is Louise’s husband. Before married in July 2017, the pair dated for 10 years.&nbsp;The pair lived in London, England, until 2017, when they relocated to New Zealand. Ray and Louise are the parents of two children. Isabella, their eldest child, was born in 2013.</p><p>Their younger child, a boy, was born on the day Louise was sworn in as New Zealand’s Prime Minister.&nbsp;Louise said that her father, Ross, was there during her Prime Minister coronation and that her mother, Laurell, was in the United Kingdom for the birth of her granddaughter.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jacinda-Ardern-1.jpg alt="Jacinda Ardern" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Jacinda Ardern’s Children And Fiance</h2><p><strong>Clark Gayford</strong>, a television broadcaster, is Jacinda Ardern’s fiance. The pair met in 2012 but did not date for quite some time.&nbsp;They began dating when Clark sought Jacinda’s opinion on a contentious Government Communications Security Bureau bill. Jacinda and Clark got engaged on May 3, 2019, after dating for many years, and they plan to marry in January 2020.</p><p>Their intended marriage, however, had to be postponed owing to the introduction of the Omicron variety of Coronavirus, and they have yet to marry. Jacinda became the second head of government to give birth while in office, after Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990.&nbsp;On July 21, 2018, she and Clark welcomed their daughter Neve Te Aroha into the world at Auckland City Hospital.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmpuZo7GiecCrm56qnmK9or7Ep6usZaedvG6t0Z5kq6ejqHqiusNmo5qtopq5rXnAq5ueqp5is6K5yKWwZpmemXqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./201408151095.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamie Dornan - Biography | HELLO!">&larr;
