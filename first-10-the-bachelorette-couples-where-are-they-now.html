Up until recently, the show has been hosted by Chris Harrison, one of America’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">longest-running reality show hosts</a>. For its 17th season, following the exit of Chris Harrison, it was revealed that former bachelorettes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tayshia Adams</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaitlyn Bristowe</a>&nbsp;would be the new hosts. The season is set to debut in June this year and has already spurred mixed emotions as Chris Harrison was a fan favorite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Former 'Bachelorette' Clare Crawley And Dale Moss Are Back Together</a></span></p><p>For the last sixteen seasons, we have seen ladies find love on The Bachelorette. The show has gained a massive following and is a favorite amongst celebrities, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber</a>. Through love triangles, highs and lows, indecisiveness, and good old affection, we’ve seen the best and worst of the bachelorettes. Some of these relationships have gone on to flourish, while others ended just as fast as they began. To recap the first ten seasons of the show, here are what the couples have been up to:</p><h2 id=andy-dorfman-and-josh-murray-split><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Andy Dorfman And Josh Murray (Split)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The tenth season of the dating show aired between May and July of 2014. Josh Murray turned out to be the last man standing. During the finale, he proposed to Dorfman. The two were engaged for the next five months and announced their breakup in January 2015. In her book, It’s Not Okay, Dorfman described her relationship with Murray as<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> ‘the most volatile and f***** up relationship of my life.</a>”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Every 'Bachelorette' Yearbook PhotoWe Could Find</a></span></p><h2 id=desiree-hartsock-and-chris-siegfried-together><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Desiree Hartsock And Chris Siegfried (Together)</span></h2><p>Desiree Hartsock returned as a bachelorette after competing on the 17th season of The Bachelor.

Roberto Martinez, on the other hand, got engaged to Kristiana Elliott in 2020, who he called his ‘forever sweetheart’.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jillian-harris-and-ed-swiderski-split><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jillian Harris And Ed Swiderski (Split)</span></h2><p>In May of 2009, Jillian Harris appeared on the fifth season of The Bachelorette.

DeAnna later got married to Stephen Stagliano, with whom she has two children. Jesse went on to marry Ann Lueders, with whom he has three children.</p><h2 id=jen-schefft-and-jerry-ferris-split><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jen Schefft And Jerry Ferris (Split)</span></h2><p>Jen Schefft debuted as the third bachelorette in January 2005.
