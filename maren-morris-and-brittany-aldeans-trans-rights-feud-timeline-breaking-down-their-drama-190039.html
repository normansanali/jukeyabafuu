Now, Brittany is using the buzz to launch a new business endeavor while Maren is focused&nbsp;on her touring. ET breaks down the feud below.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>August 23, 2022 - Brittany thanks her parents for "not changing my gender" during "tomboy phase."&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span>Brittany posted a seemingly innocuous Instagram video depicting a glam-up, but it was the accompanying caption that sparked drama.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I'd really like to thank my parents for not changing my gender when I went through my tomboy phase. I love this girly life," she wrote. Her "Trouble With Heartbreak" singer husband replied to the post, "Lmao!! I'm glad they didn't too, cause you and I wouldn't have worked out."&nbsp;</span></p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brittany Aldean (@brittanyaldean)</a></p><p><strong><span>August 26, 2022 - Cassadee Pope and Maren Morris respond.</span></strong></p><p><span>The Voice</span><span> alum </span><a href=# rel>Cassadee Pope</a><span>, who won season three of the competition series with coach </span><a href=# rel>Blake Shelton</a><span>, addressed Brittany's comment </span><a href=# rel>on Twitter</a><span>&nbsp;first.</span></p><p><span>"You'd think celebs with beauty brands would see the positives in including LGBTQ+ people in their messaging," she wrote.&nbsp;"But instead here we are, hearing someone compare their 'tomboy phase'&nbsp;to someone wanting to transition. Real nice."</span></p><p><span>Maren did not mince words as she </span><a href=# rel>chimed in with a reply</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"It’s so easy to, like, not be a scumbag human?" she tweeted.&nbsp;"Sell your clip-ins and zip it, Insurrection Barbie."</span></p><p><strong><span>Brittany doubles down.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span>Later that day, Brittany took to her Instagram Story&nbsp;and doubled down on her stance. Her response to Pope's criticism included her claiming that "Advocating for the genital mutilation of children under the disguise of love and calling it 'gender affirming care,'&nbsp;is one of the worst evils."</span></p><p><span>She added, "The other day [son] Memphis wanted to be a dinosaur, and tomorrow [daughter] Navy will want to be a cat. They’re children.”</span></p><p><span>"Some parents want to be accepted by society so badly, that they’re willing to make life-altering decisions for their children who aren’t old enough to fully comprehend the consequences of those actions," Brittany continued. "... Thankful my parents allowed me to go through my tom boy phase without changing my gender. Until then, leave children alone!"</span></p><p><strong><span>Maren shows her&nbsp;support of the LGBTQIA+ community.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span>"Y'all have been so sweet and supportive today of me and Cassadee," Maren said on her own Instagram Story. "I will say, we can handle this s**t, we have dealt with idiots for years saying insanely stupid stuff at us but I would check on your trans friends, check on your gay friends, anyone that is in country music and had to look at that bulls**t&nbsp;today and feel subhuman."</span></p><p><span>She continued to thank her fans again for their love and support, adding,&nbsp;"It was just like, I didn't really think I woke up and chose violence today, I was like, I'm so sick of looking at absolute horses**t&nbsp;on the internet and people getting away with it -- much less being celebrated for it."&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>August 27, 2022 - Ryan Hurd and Jason Aldean get involved.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span>Maren and Brittany's respective husbands, Ryan Hurd and Jason Aldean, </span><a href=# rel>publicly backed their wives</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>For Jason, it was a subtle comment on her Instagram: "MY Barbie," he wrote, referencing Maren's "Insurrection Barbie" label.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ryan offered a more strongly worded response on Twitter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Scoring quick points by picking on trans kids isn’t something that is brave at all. And I’m proud of Maren for sticking up for them. Badge of honor to have CO engage in completely normal discourse, too. Shut up and sing only applies to those who you disagree with," he wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Later, he added,&nbsp;"Getting a lot of people telling me our career is over, as if the last time she spoke up about something it disappeared. Honestly, we’re pretty ok over here. Tours are good, got a 2 year old we love, we’re f**king fine, and I promise she isn’t going to shut up now."</span></p><p><strong><span>Queer Eye</span><span>'s Jonathan Van Ness speaks out.</span></strong></p><p><span>Maren retweeted a post from </span><span>Queer Eye</span><span> star </span><a href=# rel>Jonathan Van Ness</a><span> after he praised her for </span><a href=# rel>being an ally.</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Love to see ally’s & to be clear intersex kids which make up at least 2% of all kids face genital mutilation to enforce cisgender norms everyday," </span><a href=# rel>he wrote</a><span>. "While we are at it. Trans young people under 18 almost never get surgical gender affirming surgeries. If they do & is a huge if - it happens it is with parental consent & loads of doctors. Hormone blockers & hormone blockers are reversible. lets stop the transphobic nonsense."&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>August 29, 2022 - Tour life for Maren and Jason.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span>Maren appeared to move on over the following weekend, </span><a href=# rel>sharing an update from her life on the road </a><span>with 2-year-old son, Hayes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"My baby has been out on the road with me all month and is the biggest trooper I've ever seen," she captioned a carousel of photos and videos from their recent adventures. "He's only 2, but has come alive on this run. He&nbsp;is talking more than ever, has seen every zoo, aquarium, and children's museum that America has to offer. He knows every band, crew and bus driver's name now, and lights up a room when I know how much this team has sacrificed to make my show go while they are missing their families at home."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Kids and touring is a creative adjustment that a lot of people have helped us make a reality, but we are making it work," she continued. "We miss @ryanhurd and can't wait to be home."</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, Brittany shared a series of photos from her husband's performances and a shot of her "coolest little babes," son Memphis, 4, and daughter Navy, 3.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>August 31, 2022 - Brittany launches new merch inspired by "Insurrection Barbie" slam.</span></strong></p><p><span>On Tuesday, Brittany released</span><a href=# rel> a new line</a><span> of Barbiecore-inspired shirts featuring the tagline, "Don't Tread On Our Kids."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Per usual, my words have been taken out of context over the last week," she wrote with an eyeroll emoji. "Instead of getting twisted about the twisting of my words, I've chosen to bring some good out of it." She noted that she will be supporting Operation Light Shine "to help fight child exploitation and human trafficking" with the sales.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>September 1, 2022 - Jason dropped by longtime publicity firm.</span></strong></p><p><span>After nearly two decades of working together, Nashville's powerhouse public relations firm, The GreenRoom, </span><a href=# rel>dropped Brittany's husband, Jason, as a client</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a statement to&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>Billboard</a><span>, GreenRoom co-owner Tyne Parrish said the time has come for it to part ways with the country star despite remaining big fans of his work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Music has always been and remains TheGreenRoom's core focus, so we had to make the difficult decision after 17 years to step away from representing Jason," Parrish told&nbsp;</span><span>Billboard</span><span>. "We aren't the best people for the gig anymore, but will always be big fans of his music -- he is one of the greatest live entertainers in country music."</span></p><p><strong><span>Brittany appears on </span><span>Tucker Carlson Tonight.</span></strong></p><p><span>"I'm advocating for children," she </span><a href=# rel>said on the show</a><span>. "I think that children should not be allowed to make these life-changing decisions at such a young age. They are not mature enough; they should have parents who love them and advocate for them regardless."</span></p><p><strong><span>Sept. 2, 2022 - Maren reacts to Brittany's appearance on&nbsp;</span><span>Tucker Carlson Tonight.</span></strong></p><p><span>After Brittany's interview, Maren posted a photo of herself seemingly from&nbsp;</span><span>Tucker Carlson Tonight</span><span>&nbsp;where she was labeled, "Lunatic country music person." The GRAMMY-winning country singer posted the screen shot along with the hashtag "#NewProfilePic."&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Sept. 3, 2022 - Maren's t-shirt launch raises money for trans rights groups.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span>Maren offered an update on social media less than 24 hours after launching her own&nbsp;T-shirt line with the Tucker Carlson-inspired moniker.</span></p><p><span>The country star took to Instagram and said she's raised over $100,000 since announcing Friday that her black T-shirt with the words "Maren Morris Lunatic Country Music Person" and the phone number "877-565-8860." That number directs callers to&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>Trans Line Life</a><span>, a non-profit organization that offers emotional and financial support to trans people in crisis.</span></p><p><span>Trans Line Life is also one of the two organizations that'll benefit from sales of Morris' new merch. GLAAD's&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>Transgender Media Program</a><span>&nbsp;is the other beneficiary. The program aims to work with the media to fairly and accurately tell the stories of transgender lives.</span></p><p><strong><span>RELATED CONTENT:&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p class=label>Video</p><a class=title href=#>Maren Morris Thankful for Her Marriage in Industry That's 'Tough' on Relationships (Exclusive)</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>Music</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Maren Morris Focuses on Family Time With Son Amid Brittany Aldean Feud</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Jason Aldean's Son Memphis, 4, Hospitalized for Stitches After Fall</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Maren Morris and Brittany Aldean's Husbands Jump in on Their Feud</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Maren Morris Slams Jason Aldean’s Wife Over ‘Changing My Gender’ Post</span></h3></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7psDOp6OippVjsLC5jqaYq52eYrqwvtGiqmaZnpl6o77Irauapqlirq2wxJqlrGWkp66vv4yroKCgpKh6p7HUnWStoZ2auaq6xGaZq52RoLavs4ydprCmXam1prXRZpurmZ2WenKFj2lqcg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mary-wilson-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mary Wilson Net Worth 2024">&larr;
