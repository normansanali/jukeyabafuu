Recently, Masterson was charged with three&nbsp;counts of rape, and, according to&nbsp;Global News, that could mean going to jail for up to 45 years if he is found guilty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Masterson was arrested</a> and he will have an arraignment in September 2020.&nbsp;People are curious if&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Masterson and Ashton Kutcher are still friends</a>&nbsp;and it seems like they are still in each other's lives. But Masterson's career has come crashing down and it's safe to say that it has affected his net worth.</p><h2 id=16-million-net-worth>$16&nbsp;Million Net Worth</h2><p>Since&nbsp;That 70's Show,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Masterson has had many roles</a>, and he has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$16 million net worth</a>.</p><p>According to&nbsp;In Touch Weekly, Masterson has been a DJ, calling himself DJ Mom Jeans and DJ Donkey Punch, and he has also been a "partial" restaurant owner and made some money from real estate. While no one is sure what he made to play Hyde on&nbsp;That 70's Show, Ashton Kutcher and Topher Grace were paid $250,000-$300,000 for each episode (or $6-8 million a season) which means that Masterson must have been getting a similar salary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2012, the actor talked to&nbsp;Smashing Interviews&nbsp;about his time on&nbsp;That 70's Show and how the cast was close in age to one another. He said, "I was two years older than everybody. Mila was 15, Wilmer was a senior in high school, and I was already 22 and was living in my fifth apartment and had been working forever. Kutcher, Topher, and I are all about the same age. They are a couple of years younger. Mila sort of spent a few years modeling around the world, so she had a little bit of an older vibe."</p><p>Masterson also told the publication about what it was like working in the restaurant industry. He said that it was profitable: "Seemed like a fun way to lose some money, and then we ended up not losing money. We’ve bought and sold eight restaurants. The last one is called the Geisha House, which is like a Japanese sushi restaurant. It’s awesome, then there's a Korean place, an Italian place, a steakhouse, a couple of sports bars that are doing really well, a bar in Park City, Utah and one in Hollywood."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That ’70s Show: 13 Fan Theories About Eric Forman We Can’t Ignore</a></span></p><h2 id=the-ranch>The Ranch</h2><p>Besides Steven Hyde on&nbsp;That 70's Show, Danny Masterson also had a main role on the Netflix series&nbsp;The Ranch. He starred as Colt Bennett, and Ashton Kutcher played his brother Rooster Bennett. They worked on their family's Colorado cattle ranch.</p><p>The&nbsp;recent allegations against him have affected his net worth because he was fired from that series. That meant saving goodbye to his salary. The show premiered in April 2016 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor was let go from the show in 2017</a>.</p><p>According to&nbsp;USA Today, the official statement from Netflix read, "As a result of ongoing discussions, Netflix and the producers have written Danny Masterson out of The Ranch.&nbsp;Yesterday was his last day on the show, and production will resume in early 2018 without him.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Masterson And 19 Other Actors Who Were Fired From Their TV Shows</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=legal-fees>Legal Fees</h2><p>Because of the allegations against him, Danny Masterson also has a lot of legal fees now, so that must be contributing to his overall financial picture.</p><p>According to&nbsp;The Wrap, the LAPD said in 2017 that three women accused him of sexual assault at his Hollywood Hills house, and no charges have been made. The three assaults happened in 2001 and 2003.</p><p>Danny Masterson is also involved with another case. In 2019,&nbsp;Marie Bobette Riales and a married couple named Chrissie&nbsp;Bixler and Cedric Bixler-Zavala, and "two anonymous Jane Does," filed a lawsuit against Masterson and the Church of Scientology, as&nbsp;The Wrap&nbsp;notes. The lawsuit says that the actor “conspired to and systemically stalked, harassed, invaded their family’s privacy, and intentionally caused them emotional distress to silence and intimidate them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Masterson was charged, Leah Remini, who has been very vocal after her difficult&nbsp;departure&nbsp;from Scientology, tweeted that she felt that people were finally listening. According to USA Today, she said,&nbsp;"Finally, victims are being heard when it comes to Scientology!" She continued, "This is just the beginning Scientology, your days of getting away with it is coming to an end."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That ’70s Show: 15 Controversies Fan May Not Know About</a></span></p><p>According to&nbsp;ABC News, Danny Masterson's arraignment will be on September 18th, 2020. The statement for the lawsuit reads, "We are confident that the truth will be known and hope that the charges filed today are the first steps in this long journey of healing, justice, and holding those that victimized us accountable.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That ’70s Show: 20 Things About Donna And Eric’s Relationship Fans Ignore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmq6GdXaeypLHNrWSapJyatKLAyKilrGWRnK6qutKtZJ2ZnqPGbrnArKueqqOku26txZ%2BcnKyVmXqptdJmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-vinny-cerrato-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Vinny Cerrato Make?
