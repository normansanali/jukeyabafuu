While his basketball abilities are well-known, his family has a rich background.</strong></p><p>Let us look into the fascinating world of Luke Kennard, his sister Lauren, and the Kennard family. Luke Kennard is an American professional basketball player who now represents the Memphis Grizzlies in the NBA. The outstanding shooting guard has established himself in the very competitive world of professional basketball.</p><p>Luke, born on June 24, 1996, in Franklin, Ohio, developed an early interest in the game. Kennard was a standout player at Franklin High School and one of the nation’s most coveted prospects. He also played two seasons of college basketball at Duke University before being chosen into the NBA in 2017. The Detroit Pistons selected Kennard 12th overall on June 22, 2017, and he made his NBA debut in October. He formerly played for the Los Angeles Clippers before joining the Memphis Grizzlies in 2023.</p><h2>Meet Luke Kennard. Sister: Lauren Kennard</h2><p>While Luke’s basketball abilities are well-documented, his sister, Lauren Ashley Kennard, also has ties to the sport. Lauren, born August 31, 1992, began playing basketball before losing interest in ninth grade.</p><p>Despite not pursuing the sport professionally, she grew up cheering for the Kentucky Wildcats alongside her family. Furthermore, her early participation in basketball competitions and family vacations based on Luke’s games left lasting memories.</p><p>Lauren attended Georgetown College, her father’s alma mater, and has a close bond with her NBA star brother. Lauren has been married to Phillip Holliday since July 15, 2022, and she remains a supportive figure in Luke’s life. She also considers herself Luke’s “second mum” and adores her younger brother.</p><h2>The Kennard Family Details</h2><p>Luke Kennard’s success is owed to his parents, Mark and Jennifer Kennard, who are always supportive. His father, Mark Kennard, was a star point guard at Franklin High School. Thus, he played an important role in Luke’s early basketball education. Mark, a former college basketball player, received his business administration degree in 1985.</p><p>Mark Kennard works as a Commercial Loan Officer with LCNB National Bank in his hometown of Franklin, Ohio. Notably, Mark’s teaching and leadership inspired Luke throughout his high school years, providing the framework for his college career. The father-son team spent many hours on the court, with Mark providing advice and support.</p><p>This foundation laid the groundwork for Luke’s successful journey to the NBA. Despite the hurdles and fierce competition, Luke’s perseverance and talent eventually earned him a spot in the NBA. Luke’s mother, Jennifer Kennard, has been a vital source of support.</p><p>She graduated from Miami University in 1987 and has previously worked as a substitute teacher. She then worked at Wall Colmonoy Corp-Aerobraze Division as well. Nonetheless, Jennifer played a vital role in the player’s development by fostering a nurturing environment for him.</p><p>Luke and Anna Castro have been married since August 5, 2022, following a long relationship. Finally, his on-court successes have not only made his family proud but also established him as a rising NBA star.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
