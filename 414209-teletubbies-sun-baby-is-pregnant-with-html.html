When she returned, people were shocked to see how much she had changed. Now, she has another shocking revelation.</p><p class=dh>Anybody who watched "Teletubbies" will remember the baby's face in the sun that featured in almost every episode of the beloved children's show. However, when the show ended, that tiny face disappeared.</p><p class=dh>While some may have wondered who the baby was that acted as the sun, there was no mention of her anywhere until 2014. When she finally revealed her identity, fans were shocked to see her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f4450492f16e61381f39994b334339d4f2cd8162a8c2123bde3fd7e2ef991c2e.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A baby watching "Teletubbies" on TV on December 28, 2001 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Now, she is sharing another exciting piece of news with her fans on Instagram, and it has left fans delighted that her life seems to be going well. Fans are happy to know she seems as happy now as when she played the giggling sun.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Who Is the "Teletubbies" Sun?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Jess Smith, who played the sun in "Teletubbies," said she landed the role by chance when her mother met the show's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/teletubbies-sun-baby-jess-smith-pregnant-first-child-b1113054.html>producer</a> in hospital while doctors were weighing Smith. The producer had come into the hospital to see if there were any smiley babies whose parents would be open to them signing a contract with the series.</p><p class=dh>Smith's parents agreed, and her father would sit behind the camera with toys and cars so that Smith would giggle. Her giggle soon became well-known in many households after it emanated from TVs while “Teletubbies” played.</p><p class=dh>Smith was nine months old when she landed the role, but after the show ended, she and her family decided to keep her identity private. However, in 2014, she finally revealed she was the "Teletubbies" baby. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12622251/Teletubbies-Sun-baby-pregnant-Child-star-announces-expecting-child-longterm-boyfriend.html>admitted</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I used to hide it, but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it."</p><p class=dh>She also confessed that everyone she knew said they could see the likeness between her as an adult and her as a baby. Smith said that she had not changed much because she still had a baby face and was still as giggly as she was on the show.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>What Is Smith's News?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Since she told the world who she is, Smith has received positive encouragement from people who said they remembered her and loved her in the show. However, she is all grown up now and has more exciting news to share.</p><p class=dh>Smith took to Instagram this week to share a sonogram photo and announce that she and her partner, Ricky Latham, are expecting their first child together. She shared the black-and-white photo along with a caption that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CyOoQcZLV3x/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=23b8761d-c32d-4b89-9b9f-d4be11056c9e">read</a>:</p><p class=dh>“When two becomes three.”</p><p class=dh>Fans were delighted to know that her life was progressing well, and many sent her words of congratulations. Many marveled at the fact that the “Teletubbies” baby was having a baby of her own.</p><p class=dh>Many fans also coupled their messages of congratulations with questions about being on “Teletubbies,” however, Smith neglected to answer any questions that were left under her post about her baby.</p><p class=dh>One fan even asked Smith when her due date was because she was pregnant and wondered if they might have the same date. Other fans said knowing the “Teletubbies” baby was having her own baby made them feel old.</p><p class=dh>While many fans sent words of congratulations, others wondered if Smith’s baby would play the sun baby in the upcoming Netflix <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://people.com/teletubbies-sun-baby-jess-smith-is-pregnant-expecting-first-baby-8353265?utm_campaign=peoplemagazine&utm_content=manual&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_term=65284dee0c82f000011cd42c">reboot</a> of the show, which was announced last year. However, there has been no confirmation of any such thing from the show’s creators or Smith.</p><p class=dh>The “Teletubbies” reboot was announced last year and will premiere on Netflix. While it will have notable differences from the show's first edition, there will be many similarities that viewers can enjoy.</p><p class=dh>The characters will have their exact old catchphrases, the theme song will be the same, and there will still be a sun baby present for all to enjoy. The show will also contain many new and exciting changes, though.</p><p class=dh>If you’re not into “Teletubbies” and you’re looking for something more adult to watch on Netflix, you can look forward to another season of “The Circle.” You can find all the details about the new season right <a class="me a" href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1obWpgbnq1scueq66akp6ytHnSrqVmmpGXxm610manq52Xo66vwIywoK2gXp3Brrg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ulisses-soares.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ulisses Soares Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">&larr;
