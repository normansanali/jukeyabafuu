And the star of The Queen’s Gambit, 27, appears to have found her King with husband <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Malcolm McRae</strong></a>, 29. The couple were first linked in 2021 and kept their relationship fairly quiet since. After she was spotted rocking a ring on THAT hand in June 2022, people began to wonder if <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Anya</a> and Malcolm were getting hitched.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>However, multiple outlets reported in October 2023 that the two officially married in a stunning ceremony that was held in Venice, Italy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Anya-Taylor-Joy-Malcolm-McRae-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Though they’re overall pretty private with their relationship, Anya explained why she tends to be <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>more reserved</a> about her personal life in a 2018 interview with The Guardian. “There’s a beauty in being anonymous,” she said. “There’s a reason why we’re actors… we’re playing other people, so I think the idea of someone being interested in me, I’m quite a private person, is a bit daunting, but I try not to think about it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Still, fans can’t help but want to know more about the beauty and her man. Learn everything we know about Malcolm, their relationship and marriage, here.</p><h2>Malcolm was first linked to Anya in May of 2021</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Malcolm and Anya seemed to be hot and heavy from the moment they met. The pair were <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pictured smooching</a> around New York City just ahead of her Saturday Night Live hosting gig in May 2021. Though they didn’t publicly confirm they were together, it didn’t take a genius to see they were smitten.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>That same month Anya referred to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her “partner”</a> in an interview with Elle. Hinting at the fact he was a musician, she told the magazine, “My partner’s just come back from work, and he’s moving around all of his equipment.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>She admitted she wasn’t the type to enjoy <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>casual dating</a> before meeting her love. Opening up with British Vogue in Apr. 2022, Anya said, “I was not a good dater and I’m quite glad to not be. I hear stories from my friends and I’m like, ‘God, I would suck at that.’ ”</p><h2>When did Anya and Malcom get married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Fans began thinking the pair may have <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gotten engaged</a> after the Split star was spotted rocking a ring with a green stone while in Sydney, Australia in June 2022. A month later, it was reported the duo rushed past the engagement stage and were married in an “intimate courthouse wedding” sometime that summer, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. The nuptials reportedly took place in the states before Anya went back to Australia to film the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mad Max: Fury Road</a> prequel, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Furiosa</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>However, the duo waited until the following year to host an official wedding ceremony in Italy, according to multiple outlets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Anya-Taylor-Joy-Malcolm-McRae-embed-2.jpg><h2>Malcolm is a musician</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Malcolm has quite the range of talents, according to his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDB bio</a>. He was “discovered” by the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Actors, Models & Talent for Christ</a> competition at the age of 12, winning the Over All Young Actor honor in 2006. From there, he had roles in the&nbsp;short film Brotherly (2008) and the film How’dy!&nbsp;in 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Music is McRae’s real focus though. His IMDB bio says he’s proficient in “guitar and piano” and can sing “pop, folk, rockabilly, rock and musical theatre.” His main project seems to be with his band <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>more*</strong></a>, which he plays in with <strong>Kane Ritchotte</strong>, formerly of the band <strong>Portugal The Man</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Before signing a record deal with more*, he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Songwriter</a> he was working a day job as a paralegal. Malcolm has also dabbled in modeling, appearing on the cover of Odda magazine in Sep. 2022.</p><h2>Where is Malcom from?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>According to his band more*’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spotify bio</a>, Malcolm moved to Los Angeles from the South after following a girl out west. The bio explained, “Malcolm had only recently fallen in love with a young woman and followed his foolish heart, dropping everything to move to Los Angeles. Well, his heart was mistaken. The relationship was a disaster. But the music that followed wasn’t. Within a week of meeting, the [bandmates] realized that the music they made together transcended what either was doing alone.”</p><h2>What has Anya said about Malcolm?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Though the star of Thoroughbreds said she prefers to keep her personal life private, that hasn’t stopped her from lavishing her love in praise. Talking about her dedication to him with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>British Vogue</a> in Apr. 2022, she revealed, “I said to my partner the other day that he was my hobby. I see reading as something that I have to do.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“He loved it because he’s the same,” Anya went on. “I’ve finally found someone who will happily sit in silence with me reading. We’re basically 80 years old and 7 at the same time and it works really well.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Still, the beauty said that the long-distance relationship can be “hard.” She splits her time between LA, her house in east London, and being on the road for work.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>In her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>British Vogue </a>interview, she admitted, “Yes, it is [hard], but it’s also kind of great because when you’re together you’re really valuing the time that you have. Everyday mundane activities are so full of joy. I love going to the petrol station with him and filling up the car and going to get breakfast.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yao5ynnKJ6rq%2FRmpxmbGhrgHJ8kmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./goh-27s-scorbunny.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Goh's Cinderace - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia">&larr;
