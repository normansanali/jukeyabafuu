Chad Robinson from Michigan is one among those 12 new faces.</p><p>Learn about Chad Robinson’s Love Island stint, his job, his parents, and more in the wiki article below.</p><h3>Chad Robinson On Love Island</h3><p>As part of the Casa Amor twist, we saw the original islanders split up into groups of two, with the original male participants moving to the newly Casa Amor for 4 days of temptation where Casa Amor divas were already present. The new male islanders joined the OG females in the main villa. With the original couples separated, it was interesting to see if islanders would return to their former couple or choose someone from the Casa Amor addition.</p><p>Joining alongside Chad on the Day 16 of Love Island USA Season 4 were Phoebe Siegel, Jordan Morello, Gabby Kiszk, Tre Watson, Avery Grooms, Nic Birchall, Tigerlily Cooley, Sam Kornse, Chanse Corbi, Gabriella “Bella” Barbaro, and Kyle Fraser.</p><p>Chad Robinson coupled up with bisexual islander, Courtney Boerner, in the main villa. Fans of the show seemed to enjoy the energy between Chad and Courtney and also found them adorable as a couple.</p><p>Courtney initially partnered up with Andy Voyen and then has also coupled up with Felipe Gomes and Bryce Fins. When it came to Casa Amor boys, she talked to all of them but ended up choosing Chad during the shocking recoupling ceremony. The reason she was so confused was that her taste is all over the map.</p><p>To talk a little about Courtney Boerner, she has had 19 plastic surgeries to look like the buxom beauty she is. However, she has never gone into providing details about those surgeries. Before Courtney came to Love Island USA, she was most probably pursuing a career as an influencer or model. She has also worked for Showtime PPV as a ring girl during a boxing match between Jack Paul and Tyron Woodley.</p><h3>Chad Robinson Age</h3><p>According to eoonline.com, Chad Robinson’s age was 23 as of August 2022.</p><h3>Who Are Chad Robinson Parents?</h3><p>Chad Robinson’s parents are Antonio Robinson (age 60) and Toni King Robinson (age 60).</p><p>According to Tony’s Twitter handle, she is a kindergarten teacher by profession.</p><p>Chad’s parents have been married since 1986 and they celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary on July 21, 2021.</p><p>On their 35th anniversary, Chad’s parents wore cool t-shirts with the back of their t-shirt reading “Married Since 1986.” Chad’s mother took to Facebook to share that picture and captioned the post, “Thank you, thank you for all the anniversary love!!

You truly have taken care of me during this crazy time in our life and I don’t take it for granted,” on Facebook.</p><h3>Chad Robinson Job</h3><p>According to Chad’s profile on the Peacock website, he is a personal trainer and a bartender by profession.
