Set in the titular <a href=#>Australian outback </a>town, where there’s no cellphone service or police station, the documentary covers the town’s history, the eccentric residents’&nbsp; squabbles, and the missing persons cold case of Paddy Moriarty, 70, who vanished in December 2017 along with his dog, prompting a police investigation.</p><p>With fewer than a dozen people, everybody knows each other’s business, and some of them must have known what happened to him. A missing person’s cold case in a town of fewer than a dozen residents sounds like the stuff of a movie, but the documentary unspools the story in a way that’s very real.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Paddy Moriarty, the man who vanished and was possibly murdered in a town of less than a dozen. <span class=credit>Courtesy of Max</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The hotel in Larrimah, a central location in the doc “Last Stop Larrimah.” <span class=credit>Courtesy of Max</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>“MerPeople,” Netflix&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>A new entry in the documentary category of, “you wouldn’t believe that this is a real job,” “MerPeople” is a four-part series about the world of mermaid performers, or<a href=#> people who don mermaid costumes</a> and perform underwater as “professional mermaids.”&nbsp;</p><p>Like any worthwhile doc about an unusual subculture, it’s peppered with quirky subjects, such as Sparkles, who considers herself a “landlocked mermaid” because she lives in Arkansas (“I’m s – – t out of luck, being a mermaid here,” she says on-screen).&nbsp;</p><p>The series covers all aspects of this subculture, such as the surprisingly steep cost of custom tails (which can cost $2,500 to $5,000), the importance of the pH balance of the water and various events that mermaids perform at, such as&nbsp;Weeki Wachee Springs in Florida. It also informs us that professional mermaiding is a $500 million industry, and covers the skill and stamina involved in the gig.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">One of the mermaids in “MerPeople.” <span class=credit>Andréanna Seymore/Netflix</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“MerPeople” covers the unusual subculture of underwater performers. <span class=credit>Netflix</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>“Telemarketers,” HBO&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Executive produced by Danny McBride and the Safdie brothers, this true crime docuseries follows two office workers at a telemarketing call center in New Jersey who were led to believe that they were raising money for firefighter and police charities – but instead, the money was going toward their employers.</p><p>The story follows a 20-year journey of two work pals – Sam Lipman-Stern&nbsp; and Pat Pespas – who become amateur sleuths and whistleblowers on their industry, and their crooked employers.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone loves a good scam, and this docuseries covers one from the insiders’ perspective, since Sam documented his office on video.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Patrick Pespas in “Telemarketers.” <span class=credit>HBO</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Patrick Pespas and Sam Lipman-Stern in “Telemarketers.” <span class=credit>HBO</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>“Big Vape: The Rise and Fall of Juul,” Netflix&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>This four-part docuseries is based on the book “<a href=#>Big Vape: The Incendiary Rise of Juul</a>” by Jamie Ducharme, and it covers the marketing and the rise of the Juul e-cigarette — and its alleged aim to convert cigarette smokers to Juul, including using marketing tactics <a href=#>aimed at Gen-Z.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The documentary follows the idea for the company from inception, from founders&nbsp;Adam Bowen and James Monsees, and the subsequent hot water they landed in, after <a href=#>using celebs and influencers to hook teens on vaping</a>. The founders aren’t interviewed in the series, but it features interviews from scientists, marketers, former staffers and people who had near-misses with vaping.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our marketing team was built around using influencers — partnering with fashion people and celebrities [to promote content] on social media networks like Instagram,” a former employee who worked on Juul’s supply chain<a href=#> told The Post</a>.&nbsp;“They were going to get young influencers, people that have a big following, and they were going to host parties.
