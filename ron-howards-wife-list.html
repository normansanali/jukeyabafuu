People born in the Year of the Horse are never willing to give up. They are constantly upbeat and enthusiastic, pushing themselves ahead. Their greatest ambition is to be free to do anything they want and to express themselves. They do, however, have a number of unfavorable characteristics. Horses are terrible at maintaining secrets and quickly lose interest.</p><p>People born on March 1 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>. There would almost certainly be an image of Pisces next to the term "psychic" in the dictionary. Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Director, producer, and actor who first became known as Andy Griffith’s son Opie on The Andy Griffith Show and also played teenager Richie Cunningham on Happy Days.
