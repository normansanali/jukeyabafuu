In reality, however, most people have somewhat complicated relationships with the people in their families, especially when it comes to siblings. With that in mind, it makes sense that sometimes siblings can’t help but feel jealous of one another which often continues into adulthood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that celebrities are human beings just like the rest of us, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that some stars have similarly complicated relationships with their siblings. Worse yet, since many people are so interested in stars these days, when a celebrity’s siblings do something negative it reflects on their famous brother or sister. Fortunately, in the case of some stars, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including Dave Chapelle</a>, they have a really good relationship with their siblings.</p><p>Over the last several years, Bella Thorne has found herself in the spotlight several times for reasons that have next to nothing to do with her career. Despite all of the attention Bella’s personal life has received, people don’t talk about her siblings all that often. For example, a lot of Bella Thorne’s fans know next to nothing about her older sister Dani.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Celeb Kids (You Didn't Realize Are Related)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-thorne-family>The Thorne Family</h2><p>During the ‘90s, Delancey and Tamara Thorne had four children together, Bella, Kalli, Remy, and Dani. Unfortunately for the family, the Thorne patriarch suddenly lost his life due to a traffic accident that took place in 2007. According to what Bella Thorne has said during interviews, her dad’s passing left the Thorne kids to be raised by their single mother. Of course, bringing up four kids is extremely expensive so it is understandable that the Thorne family struggled to get by on a single income for a while.</p><p>In order to help her family get by, Bella Thorne began an acting career at a very young age. Similarly, Dani Thorne has revealed that she began working as a model and doing commercials when she was only 4-years-old. After Bella Thorne became a child star, her family <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no longer needed to fear homelessness</a> but that doesn’t mean that the Thorne kids stopped working. On top of her career saving her family financially, Bella Thorne has been able to help others with her wealth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">through philanthropy</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Thorne Has A Tantalizing Way Of Donating Money</a></span></p><h2 id=bella-s-career>Bella’s Career</h2><p>Early on in Bella Thorne’s acting career, she took roles in shows like Dirty Sexy Money and My Own Worst Enemy. After cutting her teeth on those series like that, Bella managed to catch the eye of the powerbrokers at the Disney Channel which resulted in her landing a role in the show Shake It Up.</p><p>Since Bella Thorne left the Disney Channel behind, it is very safe to say that she has done many things that her former bosses would disapprove of. For example, since leaving the House of Mouse behind, Bella Thorne <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has made a living</a> appearing in more mature films including The Babysitter and its 2020 sequel The Babysitter: Killer Queen. Bella also garnered a lot of headlines when she created an OnlyFans account and she seems to have made a lot of money from that website.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Thorne Issues Apology For $2M Payday After Changes to OnlyFans Site</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=another-entertainer>Another Entertainer</h2><p>When the Thorne family is brought up, there is no doubt that Bella is the one who comes to mind first for the vast majority of people and that is for good reason. Despite the success that Bella Thorne has enjoyed during her career, she isn’t the only member of her family that has gone into the entertainment industry. For example, Bella’s sister Kaili, her brother Remy, and her other sister Dani all have IMDb pages because each of them has several acting credits.</p><p>In the case of Dani Thorne, she left acting in the rearview mirror a number of years ago as she has chosen to focus on launching a music career. Operating as a music producer and DJ, Dani has an alter ego and goes by the name COM3T. Additionally, Dani and someone named Dylan Jetson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">formed an electronic music duo</a> that went under the name Master of the People. According to womenofedm.com, Master of the People “keep the energy high, the movement fast-paced, and on your toes for the genre switch-ups. Mixing between hard electro, trap, dubstep, and future bass, Master of the People takes you on a ride.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On a personal level, it seems like Dani and Bella Thorne have a really good relationship. After all, Bella has shown up at several of Dani’s gigs so she could support her sister’s musical efforts. Additionally, Bella and Dani are so close that they like to call themselves twins, which also is pretty fitting since they look so much alike. Since the sisters are so close and have that nickname for themselves, they got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">matching tattoos</a> that read “If lost, find twin”.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Bella Thorne Single?
