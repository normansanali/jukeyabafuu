What followed was a crash course of top-down development financed in part by the sale of grain to capitalist Western countries, resulting in the starvation of at least 2.4 million people in the Ukraine.<p>Meanwhile, endless political purges prevented anyone from growing powerful enough to challenge Stalin’s hold on power. His henchmen also murdered around 20,000 Polish military officers and intellectuals after dividing Poland with Hitler in 1939 (pictured: the Katyn massacre of Polish nationals, 1940).</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)</h2><p>Death toll: 500,000</p><span class=caption-body>In 1936, Spain became the latest battleground between communist and anti-communist forces, pitting Republican fighters supported by the Soviet Union (not all of them communists) against General Francisco Franco's fascists, who ultimately triumphed.</span><span class=credit>Fox Photos/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>World War II (1939-1945; In Asia: 1931-1945)</h2><p>Death toll: 50-80 million</p><span class=caption-body>The deadliest cataclysm in human history saw the Axis of Nazi Germany, fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan stake everything on a bid for world domination, and lose.<p>At the same time that unprecedented numbers of troops took the battlefield, Axis powers carried out programs of genocide against civilian populations. The extreme racism of the Nazi ideology resulted in the deaths of some 6 million Jews along with five million other “undesirables” during the Holocaust. In Asia, the Japanese killed between 15 and 20 million Chinese citizens starting in 1931 with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, along with millions more in other occupied countries.</p><p>Pictured: Dresden, Germany after the Allied firebombing on February 13-15, 1945.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Henan Famine (1942-43)</h2><p>Death toll: 2-3 million</p><span class=caption-body>Once again, natural causes conspired with the disruption of war.

As British rule drew to an end, these tensions erupted in mass rioting and massacres, reaching a climax in the partition of majority-Hindu India and majority-Muslim Pakistan in 1947.<p>Pictured: Vultures feeding on corpses lying abandoned in an alleyway after bloody rioting between Hindus and Muslims.

The conflict began in 1927, and after a pause to fight the Japanese in the 1930s and 1940s, the bloodiest phase of the war resumed in 1945, which saw the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek and the communists under Mao Zedong face off. The latter emerged victorious and the defeated nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949.<br>Pictured: Communist forces capture the Lanzhou Yellow River bridge on August 26, 1949.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Korean War (1950-1953)</h2><p>Death toll: 3.5 million</p><span class=caption-body>A civil war pitting communists against anti-communists, the Korean War was also a proxy struggle of the Cold War, as the West backed South Korea against Marxist North Korea, supported by the USSR and China. The conflict ended with a military stalemate and the division of the peninsula into the sovereign states of North and South, causing animosities that persist to this day.<br>br>Pictured: A grief-stricken American infantryman whose buddy has been killed in action is comforted by another soldier.

This meant remaking a rural society into an industrial powerhouse, while skipping all the steps in between – and in Mao’s doctrinaire mind, development boiled down to producing lots of steel.<p>So, across China, rural communes gave up producing food to forge steel in jerry-rigged furnaces, while other communes worked “overtime” to produce more food to feed them. The result was mass starvation and a bunch of useless steel nuggets.</p><p>Pictured: Peasants in Xinyang show their zeal farming under floodlights. 1959.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Vietnam War (1954-1975)</h2><p>Death toll: 1.4-3.6 million</p><span class=caption-body>Originally a nationalist struggle against French colonial rule, the Vietnam War became yet another proxy fight in the Cold War, with communist North Vietnam supported by the Soviet Union and South Vietnam supported by the U.S. and other Western powers. In the end, the North's forces emerged victorious and reunited the country under communist rule.<p>Pictured: Thich Quang Duc, a Buddhist monk, burns himself to death on a Saigon street to protest alleged persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government.

Building up a cult of personality, Mao encouraged the "Red Guards" to persecute the older Chinese revolutionaries and tear down the country's traditional Confucian culture.

However, long-simmering ethnic and nationalist tensions erupted after the government's incompetent response to the 1970 Bhola Cyclone, which killed at least 300,000 people. A bloody civil war then broke out, and Indian intervention ultimately helped secure Bangladesh's independence.<p>Pictured: An advertisement for a George Harrison record meant to raise funds and awareness in the name of the war.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Ethiopian Civil War (1974-1991)</h2><p>Death toll: 500,000-1.5 million</p><span class=caption-body>Yet another Cold War proxy fight, the Ethiopian Civil War began in 1974 when the Marxist Derg overthrew the country's monarch, Emperor Haile Selassie with support from the USSR and Cuba.

In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge communists set out to remake the small country as an agrarian utopia by uprooting city dwellers and killing those deemed to be "intellectuals" or "foreign sympathizers," which in practice meant anyone who, for example, wore glasses or spoke a foreign language.<p>The Khmer Rouge stayed in power after the genocide, and remained there into the 1990s.</p><p>Skulls lie in the killing fields of Choeung Ek. 1981.</p></span><span class=credit>Roland Neveu/LightRocket via Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Angolan Civil War (1975-2002)</h2><p>Death toll: 500,000</p><span class=caption-body>Following Angola's independence from Portugal, it was torn apart by a Cold War struggle between Maoist rebels in UNITA, backed by the USSR and Cuba, and the central government backed by the U.S. and other Western powers. As is so often the case in Africa, the supposedly ideological struggle was often a fight for control of natural resources including diamonds and oil. And as is also so often the case in African wars, child soldiers were common.<p>Pictured: Angolan children in a military parade. 1976.</p></span><span class=credit>Keystone/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Soviet-Afghan War And The Afghan Civil War (1979-1992)</h2><p>Death toll: 500,000-2 million</p><span class=caption-body>One of the Cold War's "hot wars," the conflict began when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to back a puppet government threatened by a coup plot, orchestrated with CIA support, in 1979. The U.S. helped create an Islamist insurgency of fighters, or mujahideen, to wage a proxy war against the Soviet invaders, supplying them with Stinger missiles that helped paralyze the Soviet helicopter fleet.<p>Following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, civil war continued with the mujahideen eventually emerging victorious.</p><p>A wounded mujahideen fighter reaches out for help. 1989.</p></span><span class=credit>David Stewart-Smith/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988)</h2><p>Death toll: 1.5 million</p><span class=caption-body>In 1980 Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded neighboring Iran in a bid to conquer oil-rich border territories, but fighting soon devolved into World War I-style trench warfare, complete with poison gas and human wave attacks. Iraq received financial support from the U.S., which also helped procure weapons for the Iraqis, perhaps in retribution for the Iran hostage crisis.<p>In the end, both countries were left with a military stalemate and no significant territory having changed hands.</p><p>Pictured: Basij (mobilized volunteer forces) women in black chador carry rocket launchers.</p></span><span class=credit>Kaveh Kazemi/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>HIV/AIDS (1981-present)</h2><p>Death toll: 35 million</p><span class=caption-body>There is still disagreement about where the human immunodeficiency virus originated. One theory holds that the two main strains of the virus actually crossed over from chimpanzees or monkeys to human beings in west central Africa on several different occasions, the first sometime prior to 1931, perhaps when people ate “bush meat” infected with a strain of the simian immunodeficiency virus.<p>Then, it may have spread via global transportation networks: sailors may have brought the disease from Africa to Haiti in the 1950s or 1960s, and then the U.S. It was first identified in the U.S. among gay men in big cities in the early 1980s.</p><p>Anti-retroviral drugs debuted in the 1990s, radically changing the prognosis for patients and helping to bring the epidemic under control, despite the fact that it still claims disproportionate amounts of lives in the world's poorer, less-developed regions, namely in Africa.</p><p>Pictured: The AIDS Memorial Quilt in Washington, D.C.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Somali Civil War, 1991-present.

Meanwhile, humanity remains prey for deadly diseases that defy science – or simply thrive on negligence.</p><p>The eruption of violence and disaster in the modern era is not just a tragic coincidence. In fact, the willingness to commit unspeakable atrocities against fellow human beings stems directly from the rise of modern fanatical ideologies – chiefly nationalism, racism, communism, anti-communism, and politicized religion – all based on the idea that there is a higher law governing human affairs, for which it is not only permissible but necessary to kill.</p><p>Nationalism first arose in 19th-century Europe, where it filled the vacuum left by the retreat of the Catholic Church and later Christianity in general. Walking hand in hand with nationalism, racism, with the aid of science, allowed us to classify and sort different groups of people. Then, communism purported to provide a scientific framework for understanding history. Nazism and fascism arose in response to communism, equaling its capacity for barbarity. Later, politicized religion, including radical Islamism, claimed to present a new path but simply mirrored the inhumanity of the earlier ideologies.</p><p>In many cases, ideology has merely provided a fig leaf for some other very human qualities, notably greed and lust for power.
