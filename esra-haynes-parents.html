She will always be remembered as a young person who left us too soon.</p><p>The young girl from Victoria suffered irreversible brain damage when she went into cardiac arrest shortly after inhaling deodorant with her friends, an extremely hazardous activity also known as chroming or huffing.</p><p>Unfortunately, her brain was unable to recover, and she passed away as a result of the incident.</p><p>Esra Haynes sister said, <strong>“She fought as hard as she could.”</strong></p><p>She also said that their mother had to make a physical call and inform that Esra was unconscious and required immediate attention as she had lost her pulse and was at risk of passing away. Despite having strong lungs and a heart, Esra’s brain did not recover.</p><p>The student from Lilydale High School, who was in Year 8, was declared dead at the Royal Children’s Hospital after Esra Haynes parents had to make the difficult decision to turn off her life support. It was a heartbreaking moment for the family as they had to let go of their beloved child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Esra-Haynes-Parents.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Esra Haynes’ short but impactful life: The community mourns a bright young star</h2><p>A teenager who was one in a million has left a lasting impression on many who knew her. She will always be remembered fondly by those whose lives she touched.</p><p>Many tributes have been pouring in for Esra, a “beautiful” person who was not only an aerobics state champion but also loved to ride BMX bikes with her brothers. Her passion and talents will always be remembered by those who know her.</p><p>Esra’s sister described her as a unique and irreplaceable person, saying she was <strong>“one in a million.”</strong></p><p>The Montrose Football Netball Club, of which Esra was likely a member, expressed their sadness on their <a href=#>Facebook</a> post over the loss of a fellow member, saying they were <strong>“heartbroken.”</strong></p><p>The club said in a post that Esra had joined the club the previous year and had played in the Under-12 Girls’ team, where she fit in seamlessly.</p><p>It was stated that in her short time at the club, Esra had developed into a strong leader on the field and during training. It was further mentioned that Esra had been selected as one of the co-captains for the Under 14 Girls team for 2023.</p><p>The club described Esra as a determined, fun, cheeky, and talented individual. Her teammates, coaches, and the wider community of the club would greatly miss her.</p><p>Jason Wood, who is the federal Liberal Member of Parliament for La Trobe, also took to social media to share his thoughts and condolences.</p><p>Wood stated that the community was mourning the loss of a determined and kind year 8 student. During this difficult time, he expressed his thoughts and prayers with her friends, family, and the wider community.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCx0quYZqCRrrumv4ypmKudnqnAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./asim-munir-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-587000-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Asim Munir Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
