Mallett, 35, who previously played as a quarterback for the New England Patriots, was on vacation with his girlfriend, Madison Carter, when the accident occurred on June 27. Carter, a medical student at Arkansas State University, took to social media on Sunday night, July 2, to voice her grief and regret over the incident.</p><p>Carter poured out her emotions in a Facebook post, expressing her belief in God's plan but struggling to comprehend the tragedy. She conveyed her sorrow and apologized to Mallett for not being able to save him, emphasizing the efforts she made to rescue him. "I trust that God has a plan for everything, but I don't think I will ever understand why this happened. I'm so sorry I couldn't save you, and I hope you know how hard I tried," Carter wrote.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>ZOFF: Redefining American cuisine with authentic Indian spices</a></p><h2 class=split>Details of tragic incident</h2><p>According to the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office, the accident unfolded when Mallett encountered difficulties while attempting to swim to a sandbar approximately 150 feet (46 meters) from the beach near Gulf Shores Drive. Lifeguards promptly responded to the situation and pulled him from the water, but unfortunately, he was unresponsive. Despite immediate medical attention, Mallett, a native of Arkansas, was pronounced dead at a local hospital.</p><p>Sheriff Eric Aden dispelled any misconceptions surrounding Mallett's death, refuting claims that he was caught in a rip tide. Aden stated that the incident appeared to be a tragic accident, unrelated to the surf conditions, tides, or currents. "It just seems to be a tragic accident and not something to do with the conditions of the surf or tides or currents," Sheriff Aden clarified.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'He's throwing fists': Internet amused as ousted Rep George Santos targets Brandon Williams in bad-mouthing spree</a></p><h2 class=split>Mallett's NFL career and coaching role</h2><p>Ryan Mallett had a notable career in the National Football League (NFL). He was initially drafted by the New England Patriots in 2011 and later traded to the Houston Texans in 2014. During his time with the Texans, Mallett started six games from 2014 to 2015. However, he was released in the midst of the 2015 season. Mallett subsequently joined the Baltimore Ravens, where he played for two-plus seasons before retiring.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Isla McNabb: Kentucky toddler who learned to read at age 2 becomes youngest female member of Mensa</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b78bfcda-455e-4d19-bdf6-bd4af5f1be4d.jpg><p>Most recently, Mallett had taken on the role of head football coach at White Hall High School in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. His coaching tenure began in 2022, and he had just completed his first year with the team. The school district issued a statement mourning the loss of Mallett, describing him as a beloved coach and educator.</p><h2 class=split>Heartfelt tribute post from Madison Carter</h2><p>In her emotional Facebook post, Madison Carter paid tribute to Ryan Mallett, acknowledging his remarkable personality and passion for football. “Everyone knows how talented, dedicated, and passionate you were about the game of football.” Carter wrote. “Those of us who were lucky enough to know your heart know that it was even bigger than your larger-than-life personality and stature. Nothing was ever about you, it was always about others. Multiple times, I heard you say ‘there are so many good people in this world,’ and that statement alone shows what kind of person you were. Always looking for the good."</p><p>She continued, "I can never thank you enough for loving me the way that you did. In such a short time, you showed me the love I have prayed for my entire life. You loved me fiercely and unapologetically. We were planning our future. We were just getting started. I’m sure some think we’re crazy for feeling the way we did about each other in such a short time. I thought we were crazy at first too. But you helped me understand that when two souls connect the way ours did, love has no set timeline."</p><p>Carter then expressed the depth of her grief and professed her enduring love for Mallett, vowing to cherish the memories they shared and eagerly anticipate their reunion. "Words cannot convey how badly I miss you. I hope you know how loved you are. By myself, your amazing family, your friends, your teammates, your students, and countless others. I don't know how I'll ever get past this. But I'm so honored to love you and be loved by you. You changed my life, and I'm forever grateful for the time we had. No amount of time would have ever been enough. I love you, Ryan. Please watch over us. I can't wait to see you again," Carter concluded.</p><p>The funeral service for Ryan Mallett will be held on Thursday, July 6, at 2 pm at Central United Methodist Church in Fayetteville, Arkansas. In a show of support, the family has requested that memorial contributions be made to various local charities in lieu of flowers, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Houston Chronicle</a>&nbsp;reported.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>First Pets: Furry White House companions through the ages</a></p><p><a href=#>From shooting survivor to lifesaver: Phoenix cop shot in March now champions blood donations</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonahiu6e4jKyrmqpdp8aiuoymmKWklanBtHnPq5ygppGjwW6zxWakmpyZqLyvecKaqa2domK9prrSZp%2BemaKpr7OxwKSgp59dqb%2BqrtStnGaZlqmys3nHoqpmrKKWtKqvjJ2cmqyYYrmwwsRmn5qrXaO8bsDIppyloZ6a</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-chobani-yogurt-halal-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is chobani yogurt halal">&larr;
